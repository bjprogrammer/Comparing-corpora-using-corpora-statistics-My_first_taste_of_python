I have\\r\\nnoted elsewhere how he always held that the actor doubled the value of\\r\\nthe author’s words; and he was a great actor as well as a great author.\\r\\nHe was a most consummate actor, with this difference from other actors,\\r\\nthat he was the first to know the thoughts and invent the fancies to\\r\\nwhich his voice and action gave the color of life. Representation is the\\r\\nart of other actors; his art was creative as well as representative; it\\r\\nwas nothing at second hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nI never heard Clemens speak when I thought he quite failed; some burst\\r\\nor spurt redeemed him when he seemed flagging short of the goal, and,\\r\\nwhoever else was in the running, he came in ahead. His near-failures\\r\\nwere the error of a rare trust to the spontaneity in which other\\r\\nspeakers confide, or are believed to confide, when they are on\\r\\ntheir feet. He knew that from the beginning of oratory the orator’s\\r\\nspontaneity was for the silence and solitude of the closet where he\\r\\nmused his words to an imagined audience; that this was the use of\\r\\norators from Demosthenes and Cicero up and down. He studied every word\\r\\nand syllable, and memorized them by a system of mnemonics peculiar\\r\\nto himself, consisting of an arbitrary arrangement of things on a\\r\\ntable—knives, forks, salt-cellars; inkstands, pens, boxes, or whatever\\r\\nwas at hand—which stood for points and clauses and climaxes, and were\\r\\nat once indelible diction and constant suggestion. He studied every tone\\r\\nand every gesture, and he forecast the result with the real audience\\r\\nfrom its result with that imagined audience. Therefore, it was beautiful\\r\\nto see him and to hear him; he rejoiced in the pleasure he gave and the\\r\\nblows of surprise which he dealt; and because he had his end in mind, he\\r\\nknew when to stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been talking of his method and manner; the matter the reader has\\r\\nhere before him; and it is good matter, glad, honest, kind, just.\\r\\n\\r\\nW. D. HOWELLS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREFACE\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM THE PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION OF “MARK TWAIN’S SKETCHES”\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I were to sell the reader a barrel of molasses, and he, instead of\\r\\nsweetening his substantial dinner with the same at judicious intervals,\\r\\nshould eat the entire barrel at one sitting, and then abuse me for\\r\\nmaking him sick, I would say that he deserved to be made sick for not\\r\\nknowing any better how to utilize the blessings this world affords.\\r\\nAnd if I sell to the reader this volume of nonsense, and he, instead of\\r\\nseasoning his graver reading with a chapter of it now and then, when his\\r\\nmind demands such relaxation, unwisely overdoses himself with several\\r\\nchapters of it at a single sitting, he will deserve to be nauseated, and\\r\\nhe will have nobody to blame but himself if he is. There is no more sin\\r\\nin publishing an entire volume of nonsense than there is in keeping a\\r\\ncandy-store with no hardware in it. It lies wholly with the customer\\r\\nwhether he will injure himself by means of either, or will derive\\r\\nfrom them the benefits which they will afford him if he uses their\\r\\npossibilities judiciously.\\r\\n\\r\\nRespectfully submitted,\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE AUTHOR.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                          MARK TWAIN’S SPEECHES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STORY OF A SPEECH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          An address delivered in 1877, and a review of it twenty-nine\\r\\n          years later.  The original speech was delivered at a dinner\\r\\n          given by the publishers of The Atlantic Monthly in honor of the\\r\\n          seventieth anniversary o f the birth of John Greenleaf\\r\\n          Whittier, at the Hotel Brunswick, Boston, December 17, 1877.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an occasion peculiarly meet for the digging up of pleasant\\r\\nreminiscences concerning literary folk; therefore I will drop lightly\\r\\ninto history myself. Standing here on the shore of the Atlantic and\\r\\ncontemplating certain of its largest literary billows, I am reminded\\r\\nof a thing which happened to me thirteen years ago, when I had just\\r\\nsucceeded in stirring up a little Nevadian literary puddle myself, whose\\r\\nspume-flakes were beginning to blow thinly Californiaward. I started an\\r\\ninspection tramp through the southern mines of California. I was callow\\r\\nand conceited, and I resolved to try the virtue of my ‘nom de guerre’.\\r\\n\\r\\nI very soon had an opportunity. I knocked at a miner’s lonely log cabin\\r\\nin the foot-hills of the Sierras just at nightfall. It was snowing at\\r\\nthe time. A jaded, melancholy man of fifty, barefooted, opened the door\\r\\nto me. When he heard my ‘nom de guerre’ he looked more dejected than\\r\\nbefore. He let me in—pretty reluctantly, I thought—and after the\\r\\ncustomary bacon and beans, black coffee and hot whiskey, I took a pipe.\\r\\nThis sorrowful man had not said three words up to this time. Now he\\r\\nspoke up and said, in the voice of one who is secretly suffering,\\r\\n“You’re the fourth—I’m going to move.” “The fourth what?” said I. “The\\r\\nfourth littery man that has been here in twenty-four hours—I’m going\\r\\nto move.” “You don’t tell me!” said I; “who were the others?” “Mr.\\r\\nLongfellow, Mr. Emerson, and Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes—consound the\\r\\nlot!”\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can easily believe I was interested. I supplicated—three hot\\r\\nwhiskeys did the rest—and finally the melancholy miner began. Said he:\\r\\n\\r\\n“They came here just at dark yesterday evening, and I let them in of\\r\\ncourse. Said they were going to the Yosemite. They were a rough lot, but\\r\\nthat’s nothing; everybody looks rough that travels afoot. Mr. Emerson\\r\\nwas a seedy little bit of a chap, red-headed. Mr. Holmes was as fat as\\r\\na balloon; he weighed as much as three hundred, and had double chins\\r\\nall the way down to his stomach. Mr. Longfellow was built like a\\r\\nprizefighter. His head was cropped and bristly, like as if he had a wig\\r\\nmade of hair-brushes. His nose lay straight down his face, like a finger\\r\\nwith the end joint tilted up. They had been drinking, I could see that.\\r\\nAnd what queer talk they used! Mr. Holmes inspected this cabin, then he\\r\\ntook me by the buttonhole, and says he:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          “‘Through the deep caves of thought\\r\\n          I hear a voice that sings,\\r\\n          Build thee more stately mansions,\\r\\n          O my soul!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Says I, ‘I can’t afford it, Mr. Holmes, and moreover I don’t want to.’\\r\\nBlamed if I liked it pretty well, either, coming from a stranger, that\\r\\nway. However, I started to get out my bacon and beans, when Mr. Emerson\\r\\ncame and looked on awhile, and then he takes me aside by the buttonhole\\r\\nand says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          “‘Give me agates for my meat;\\r\\n          Give me cantharids to eat;\\r\\n          From air and ocean bring me foods,\\r\\n          From all zones and altitudes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Says I, ‘Mr. Emerson, if you’ll excuse me, this ain’t no hotel.’ You\\r\\nsee it sort of riled me—I warn’t used to the ways of littery swells.\\r\\nBut I went on a-sweating over my work, and next comes Mr. Longfellow and\\r\\nbuttonholes me, and interrupts me. Says he:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          “‘Honor be to Mudjekeewis!\\r\\n          You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis--’\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I broke in, and says I, ‘Beg your pardon, Mr. Longfellow, if you’ll\\r\\nbe so kind as to hold your yawp for about five minutes and let me get\\r\\nthis grub ready, you’ll do me proud.’ Well, sir, after they’d filled up\\r\\nI set out the jug. Mr. Holmes looks at it, and then he fires up all of a\\r\\nsudden and yells:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          “Flash out a stream of blood-red wine!\\r\\n          For I would drink to other days.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“By George, I was getting kind of worked up. I don’t deny it, I was\\r\\ngetting kind of worked up. I turns to Mr. Holmes, and says I, ‘Looky\\r\\nhere, my fat friend, I’m a-running this shanty, and if the court knows\\r\\nherself, you’ll take whiskey straight or you’ll go dry.’ Them’s the\\r\\nvery words I said to him. Now I don’t want to sass such famous littery\\r\\npeople, but you see they kind of forced me. There ain’t nothing\\r\\nonreasonable ‘bout me; I don’t mind a passel of guests a-treadin’ on\\r\\nmy tail three or four times, but when it comes to standing on it it’s\\r\\ndifferent, ‘and if the court knows herself,’ I says, ‘you’ll take\\r\\nwhiskey straight or you’ll go dry.’ Well, between drinks they’d swell\\r\\naround the cabin and strike attitudes and spout; and pretty soon they\\r\\ngot out a greasy old deck and went to playing euchre at ten cents a\\r\\ncorner—on trust. I began to notice some pretty suspicious things. Mr.\\r\\nEmerson dealt, looked at his hand, shook his head, says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          “‘I am the doubter and the doubt--’\\r\\n\\r\\nand ca’mly bunched the hands and went to shuffling for a new layout.\\r\\nSays he:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          “‘They reckon ill who leave me out;\\r\\n          They know not well the subtle ways I keep.\\r\\n          I pass and deal again!’\\r\\n\\r\\nHang’d if he didn’t go ahead and do it, too! Oh, he was a cool one!\\r\\nWell, in about a minute things were running pretty tight, but all of a\\r\\nsudden I see by Mr. Emerson’s eye he judged he had ‘em. He had already\\r\\ncorralled two tricks, and each of the others one. So now he kind of\\r\\nlifts a little in his chair and says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          “‘I tire of globes and aces!\\r\\n          Too long the game is played!’\\r\\n\\r\\n—and down he fetched a right bower. Mr. Longfellow smiles as sweet as\\r\\npie and says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          “‘Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,\\r\\n          For the lesson thou hast taught,’\\r\\n\\r\\n—and blamed if he didn’t down with another right bower! Emerson claps\\r\\nhis hand on his bowie, Longfellow claps his on his revolver, and I went\\r\\nunder a bunk. There was going to be trouble; but that monstrous Holmes\\r\\nrose up, wobbling his double chins, and says he, ‘Order, gentlemen; the\\r\\nfirst man that draws, I’ll lay down on him and smother him!’ All quiet\\r\\non the Potomac, you bet!\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were pretty how-come-you-so by now, and they begun to blow.\\r\\nEmerson says, ‘The nobbiest thing I ever wrote was “Barbara Frietchie.”’\\r\\nSays Longfellow, ‘It don’t begin with my “Biglow Papers.”’ Says Holmes,\\r\\n‘My “Thanatopsis” lays over ‘em both.’ They mighty near ended in a\\r\\nfight. Then they wished they had some more company—and Mr. Emerson\\r\\npointed to me and says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          “‘Is yonder squalid peasant all\\r\\n          That this proud nursery could breed?’\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a-whetting his bowie on his boot—so I let it pass. Well, sir,\\r\\nnext they took it into their heads that they would like some music; so\\r\\nthey made me stand up and sing “When Johnny Comes Marching Home” till\\r\\nI dropped-at thirteen minutes past four this morning. That’s what I’ve\\r\\nbeen through, my friend. When I woke at seven, they were leaving, thank\\r\\ngoodness, and Mr. Longfellow had my only boots on, and his’n under his\\r\\narm. Says I, ‘Hold on, there, Evangeline, what are you going to do with\\r\\nthem?’ He says, ‘Going to make tracks with ‘em; because:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          “‘Lives of great men all remind us\\r\\n          We can make our lives sublime;\\r\\n          And, departing, leave behind us\\r\\n          Footprints on the sands of time.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“As I said, Mr. Twain, you are the fourth in twenty-four hours—and I’m\\r\\ngoing to move; I ain’t suited to a littery atmosphere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI said to the miner, “Why, my dear sir, these were not the gracious\\r\\nsingers to whom we and the world pay loving reverence and homage; these\\r\\nwere impostors.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe miner investigated me with a calm eye for a while; then said he,\\r\\n“Ah! impostors, were they? Are you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not pursue the subject, and since then I have not travelled on my\\r\\n‘nom de guerre’ enough to hurt. Such was the reminiscence I was moved\\r\\nto contribute, Mr. Chairman. In my enthusiasm I may have exaggerated\\r\\nthe details a little, but you will easily forgive me that fault, since\\r\\nI believe it is the first time I have ever deflected from perpendicular\\r\\nfact on an occasion like this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                     .........................\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Mark Twain’s Autobiography.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 11, 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnswer to a letter received this morning:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     DEAR MRS. H.,--I am forever your debtor for reminding me of that\\r\\n     curious passage in my life.  During the first year or, two after it\\r\\n     happened, I could not bear to think of it.  My pain and shame were\\r\\n     so intense, and my sense of having been an imbecile so settled,\\r\\n     established and confirmed, that I drove the episode entirely from my\\r\\n     mind--and so all these twenty-eight or twenty-nine years I have\\r\\n     lived in the conviction that my performance of that time was coarse,\\r\\n     vulgar, and destitute of humor.  But your suggestion that you and\\r\\n     your family found humor in it twenty-eight years ago moved me to\\r\\n     look into the matter.  So I commissioned a Boston typewriter to\\r\\n     delve among the Boston papers of that bygone time and send me a copy\\r\\n     of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n     It came this morning, and if there is any vulgarity about it I am\\r\\n     not able to discover it.  If it isn’t innocently and ridiculously\\r\\n     funny, I am no judge.  I will see to it that you get a copy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I have said to Mrs. H. is true. I did suffer during a year or two\\r\\nfrom the deep humiliations of that episode. But at last, in 1888, in\\r\\nVenice, my wife and I came across Mr. and Mrs. A. P. C., of Concord,\\r\\nMassachusetts, and a friendship began then of the sort which nothing\\r\\nbut death terminates. The C.’s were very bright people and in every way\\r\\ncharming and companionable. We were together a month or two in Venice\\r\\nand several months in Rome, afterward, and one day that lamented break\\r\\nof mine was mentioned. And when I was on the point of lathering those\\r\\npeople for bringing it to my mind when I had gotten the memory of it\\r\\nalmost squelched, I perceived with joy that the C.’s were indignant\\r\\nabout the way that my performance had been received in Boston. They\\r\\npoured out their opinions most freely and frankly about the frosty\\r\\nattitude of the people who were present at that performance, and about\\r\\nthe Boston newspapers for the position they had taken in regard to the\\r\\nmatter. That position was that I had been irreverent beyond belief,\\r\\nbeyond imagination. Very well; I had accepted that as a fact for a year\\r\\nor two, and had been thoroughly miserable about it whenever I thought of\\r\\nit—which was not frequently, if I could help it. Whenever I thought\\r\\nof it I wondered how I ever could have been inspired to do so unholy\\r\\na thing. Well, the C.’s comforted me, but they did not persuade me to\\r\\ncontinue to think about the unhappy episode. I resisted that. I tried to\\r\\nget it out of my mind, and let it die, and I succeeded. Until Mrs. H.’s\\r\\nletter came, it had been a good twenty-five years since I had thought\\r\\nof that matter; and when she said that the thing was funny I wondered if\\r\\npossibly she might be right. At any rate, my curiosity was aroused, and\\r\\nI wrote to Boston and got the whole thing copied, as above set forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI vaguely remember some of the details of that gathering—dimly I can\\r\\nsee a hundred people—no, perhaps fifty—shadowy figures sitting at tables\\r\\nfeeding, ghosts now to me, and nameless forevermore. I don’t know who\\r\\nthey were, but I can very distinctly see, seated at the grand table and\\r\\nfacing the rest of us, Mr. Emerson, supernaturally grave, unsmiling; Mr.\\r\\nWhittier, grave, lovely, his beautiful spirit shining out of his face;\\r\\nMr. Longfellow, with his silken white hair and his benignant face;\\r\\nDr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, flashing smiles and affection and all\\r\\ngood-fellowship everywhere like a rose-diamond whose facets are being\\r\\nturned toward the light first one way and then another—a charming man,\\r\\nand always fascinating, whether he was talking or whether he was sitting\\r\\nstill (what he would call still, but what would be more or less motion\\r\\nto other people). I can see those figures with entire distinctness\\r\\nacross this abyss of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne other feature is clear—Willie Winter (for these past thousand years\\r\\ndramatic editor of the New York Tribune, and still occupying that high\\r\\npost in his old age) was there. He was much younger then than he is now,\\r\\nand he showed ‘it. It was always a pleasure to me to see Willie Winter\\r\\nat a banquet. During a matter of twenty years I was seldom at a banquet\\r\\nwhere Willie Winter was not also present, and where he did not read a\\r\\ncharming poem written for the occasion. He did it this time, and it was\\r\\nup to standard: dainty, happy, choicely phrased, and as good to listen\\r\\nto as music, and sounding exactly as if it was pouring unprepared out of\\r\\nheart and brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow at that point ends all that was pleasurable about that notable\\r\\ncelebration of Mr. Whittier’s seventieth birthday—because I got up at\\r\\nthat point and followed Winter, with what I have no doubt I supposed\\r\\nwould be the gem of the evening—the gay oration above quoted from the\\r\\nBoston paper. I had written it all out the day before and had\\r\\nperfectly memorized it, and I stood up there at my genial and happy and\\r\\nself-satisfied ease, and began to deliver it. Those majestic guests;\\r\\nthat row of venerable and still active volcanoes, listened; as did\\r\\neverybody else in the house, with attentive interest. Well, I delivered\\r\\nmyself of—we’ll say the first two hundred words of my speech. I was\\r\\nexpecting no returns from that part of the speech, but this was not the\\r\\ncase as regarded the rest of it. I arrived now at the dialogue: “The old\\r\\nminer said, ‘You are the fourth, I’m going to move.’ ‘The fourth what?’\\r\\nsaid I. He answered, ‘The fourth littery man that has been here in\\r\\ntwenty-four hours. I am going to move.’ ‘Why, you don’t tell me;’ said\\r\\nI. ‘Who were the others?’ ‘Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson, Mr. Oliver\\r\\nWendell Holmes, consound the lot—’”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, then, the house’s attention continued, but the expression of\\r\\ninterest in the faces turned to a sort of black frost. I wondered\\r\\nwhat the trouble was. I didn’t know. I went on, but with difficulty—I\\r\\nstruggled along, and entered upon that miner’s fearful description\\r\\nof the bogus Emerson, the bogus Holmes, the bogus Longfellow, always\\r\\nhoping—but with a gradually perishing hope that somebody—would laugh, or\\r\\nthat somebody would at least smile, but nobody did. I didn’t know enough\\r\\nto give it up and sit down, I was too new to public speaking, and so I\\r\\nwent on with this awful performance, and carried it clear through to\\r\\nthe end, in front of a body of people who seemed turned to stone with\\r\\nhorror. It was the sort of expression their faces would have worn if\\r\\nI had been making these remarks about the Deity and the rest of the\\r\\nTrinity; there is no milder way, in which to describe the petrified\\r\\ncondition and the ghastly expression of those people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I sat down it was with a heart which had long ceased to beat.\\r\\nI shall never be as dead again as I was then. I shall never be as\\r\\nmiserable again as I was then. I speak now as one who doesn’t know what\\r\\nthe condition of things may be in the next world, but in this one I\\r\\nshall never be as wretched again as I was then. Howells, who was near\\r\\nme, tried to say a comforting word, but couldn’t get beyond a gasp.\\r\\nThere was no use—he understood the whole size of the disaster. He had\\r\\ngood intentions, but the words froze before they could get out. It\\r\\nwas an atmosphere that would freeze anything. If Benvenuto Cellini’s\\r\\nsalamander had been in that place he would not have survived to be put\\r\\ninto Cellini’s autobiography. There was a frightful pause. There was an\\r\\nawful silence, a desolating silence. Then the next man on the list had\\r\\nto get up—there was no help for it. That was Bishop—Bishop had just\\r\\nburst handsomely upon the world with a most acceptable novel, which had\\r\\nappeared in The Atlantic Monthly, a place which would make any novel\\r\\nrespectable and any author noteworthy. In this case the novel itself was\\r\\nrecognized as being, without extraneous help, respectable. Bishop was\\r\\naway up in the public favor, and he was an object of high interest,\\r\\nconsequently there was a sort of national expectancy in the air; we may\\r\\nsay our American millions were standing, from Maine to Texas and from\\r\\nAlaska to Florida, holding their breath, their lips parted, their hands\\r\\nready to applaud, when Bishop should get up on that occasion, and for\\r\\nthe first time in his life speak in public. It was under these damaging\\r\\nconditions that he got up to “make good,” as the vulgar say. I had\\r\\nspoken several times before, and that is the reason why I was able to\\r\\ngo on without dying in my tracks, as I ought to have done—but Bishop\\r\\nhad had no experience. He was up facing those awful deities—facing those\\r\\nother people, those strangers—facing human beings for the first time in\\r\\nhis life, with a speech to utter. No doubt it was well packed away in\\r\\nhis memory, no doubt it was fresh and usable, until I had been heard\\r\\nfrom. I suppose that after that, and under the smothering pall of that\\r\\ndreary silence, it began to waste away and disappear out of his head\\r\\nlike the rags breaking from the edge of a fog, and presently there\\r\\nwasn’t any fog left. He didn’t go on—he didn’t last long. It was not\\r\\nmany sentence’s after his first before he began to hesitate, and break,\\r\\nand lose his grip, and totter, and wobble, and at last he slumped down\\r\\nin a limp and mushy pile.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, the programme for the occasion was probably not more than\\r\\none-third finished, but it ended there. Nobody rose. The next man hadn’t\\r\\nstrength enough to get up, and everybody looked so dazed, so stupefied,\\r\\nparalyzed; it was impossible for anybody to do anything, or even try.\\r\\nNothing could go on in that strange atmosphere. Howells mournfully, and\\r\\nwithout words, hitched himself to Bishop and me and supported us out of\\r\\nthe room. It was very kind—he was most generous. He towed us tottering\\r\\naway into some room in that building, and we sat down there. I don’t\\r\\nknow what my remark was now, but I know the nature of it. It was the\\r\\nkind of remark you make when you know that nothing in the world can\\r\\nhelp your case. But Howells was honest—he had to say the heart-breaking\\r\\nthings he did say: that there was no help for this calamity, this\\r\\nshipwreck, this cataclysm; that this was the most disastrous thing that\\r\\nhad ever happened in anybody’s history—and then he added, “That is, for\\r\\nyou—and consider what you have done for Bishop. It is bad enough in\\r\\nyour case, you deserve to suffer. You have committed this crime, and you\\r\\ndeserve to have all you are going to get. But here is an innocent man.\\r\\nBishop had never done you any harm, and see what you have done to him.\\r\\nHe can never hold his head up again. The world can never look upon\\r\\nBishop as being a live person. He is a corpse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the history of that episode of twenty-eight years ago, which\\r\\npretty nearly killed me with shame during that first year or two\\r\\nwhenever it forced its way into my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow then, I take that speech up and examine it. As I said, it arrived\\r\\nthis morning, from Boston. I have read it twice, and unless I am an\\r\\nidiot, it hasn’t a single defect in it from the first word to the last.\\r\\nIt is just as good as good can be. It is smart; it is saturated with\\r\\nhumor. There isn’t a suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in it\\r\\nanywhere. What could have been the matter with that house? It is\\r\\namazing, it is incredible, that they didn’t shout with laughter, and\\r\\nthose deities the loudest of them all. Could the fault have been with\\r\\nme? Did I lose courage when I saw those great men up there whom I was\\r\\ngoing to describe in such a strange fashion? If that happened, if I\\r\\nshowed doubt, that can account for it, for you can’t be successfully\\r\\nfunny if you show that you are afraid of it. Well, I can’t account for\\r\\nit, but if I had those beloved and revered old literary immortals back\\r\\nhere now on the platform at Carnegie Hall I would take that same old\\r\\nspeech, deliver it, word for word, and melt them till they’d run all\\r\\nover that stage. Oh, the fault must have been with me, it is not in the\\r\\nspeech at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPLYMOUTH ROCK AND THE PILGRIMS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE FIRST ANNUAL DINNER, N. E.  SOCIETY,\\r\\n          PHILADELPHIA, DECEMBER 22, 1881\\r\\n\\r\\n          On calling upon Mr. Clemens to make response,\\r\\n          President Rollins said:\\r\\n\\r\\n          “This sentiment has been assigned to one who was never exactly\\r\\n          born in New England, nor, perhaps, were any of his ancestors.\\r\\n          He is not technically, therefore, of New England descent.\\r\\n          Under the painful circumstances in which he has found himself,\\r\\n          however, he has done the best he could--he has had all his\\r\\n          children born there, and has made of himself a New England\\r\\n          ancestor.  He is a self-made man.  More than this, and better\\r\\n          even, in cheerful, hopeful, helpful literature he is of New\\r\\n          England ascent.  To ascend there in any thing that’s reasonable\\r\\n          is difficult; for--confidentially, with the door shut--we all\\r\\n          know that they are the brightest, ablest sons of that goodly\\r\\n          land who never leave it, and it is among and above them that\\r\\n          Mr. Twain has made his brilliant and permanent ascent--become\\r\\n          a man of mark.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI rise to protest. I have kept still for years; but really I think there\\r\\nis no sufficient justification for this sort of thing. What do you want\\r\\nto celebrate those people for?—those ancestors of yours of 1620—the\\r\\nMayflower tribe, I mean. What do you want to celebrate them for? Your\\r\\npardon: the gentleman at my left assures me that you are not celebrating\\r\\nthe Pilgrims themselves, but the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth\\r\\nrock on the 22d of December. So you are celebrating their landing. Why,\\r\\nthe other pretext was thin enough, but this is thinner than ever;\\r\\nthe other was tissue, tinfoil, fish-bladder, but this is gold-leaf.\\r\\nCelebrating their lauding! What was there remarkable about it, I would\\r\\nlike to know? What can you be thinking of? Why, those Pilgrims had been\\r\\nat sea three or four months. It was the very middle of winter: it was\\r\\nas cold as death off Cape Cod there. Why shouldn’t they come ashore? If\\r\\nthey hadn’t landed there would be some reason for celebrating the fact:\\r\\nIt would have been a case of monumental leatherheadedness which the\\r\\nworld would not willingly let die. If it had been you, gentlemen, you\\r\\nprobably wouldn’t have landed, but you have no shadow of right to be\\r\\ncelebrating, in your ancestors, gifts which they did not exercise,\\r\\nbut only transmitted. Why, to be celebrating the mere landing of the\\r\\nPilgrims—to be trying to make out that this most natural and simple and\\r\\ncustomary procedure was an extraordinary circumstance—a circumstance\\r\\nto be amazed at, and admired, aggrandized and glorified, at orgies like\\r\\nthis for two hundred and sixty years—hang it, a horse would have known\\r\\nenough to land; a horse—Pardon again; the gentleman on my right assures\\r\\nme that it was not merely the landing of the Pilgrims that we are\\r\\ncelebrating, but the Pilgrims themselves. So we have struck an\\r\\ninconsistency here—one says it was the landing, the other says it was\\r\\nthe Pilgrims. It is an inconsistency characteristic of your intractable\\r\\nand disputatious tribe, for you never agree about anything but Boston.\\r\\nWell, then, what do you want to celebrate those Pilgrims for? They\\r\\nwere a mighty hard lot—you know it. I grant you, without the slightest\\r\\nunwillingness, that they were a deal more gentle and merciful and just\\r\\nthan were the people of Europe of that day; I grant you that they are\\r\\nbetter than their predecessors. But what of that?—that is nothing.\\r\\nPeople always progress. You are better than your fathers and\\r\\ngrandfathers were (this is the first time I have ever aimed a\\r\\nmeasureless slander at the departed, for I consider such things\\r\\nimproper). Yes, those among you who have not been in the penitentiary,\\r\\nif such there be, are better than your fathers and grandfathers were;\\r\\nbut is that any sufficient reason for getting up annual dinners and\\r\\ncelebrating you? No, by no means—by no means. Well, I repeat, those\\r\\nPilgrims were a hard lot. They took good care of themselves, but they\\r\\nabolished everybody else’s ancestors. I am a border-ruffian from the\\r\\nState of Missouri. I am a Connecticut Yankee by adoption. In me, you\\r\\nhave Missouri morals, Connecticut culture; this, gentlemen, is the\\r\\ncombination which makes the perfect man. But where are my ancestors?\\r\\nWhom shall I celebrate? Where shall I find the raw material?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first American ancestor, gentlemen, was an Indian—an early Indian.\\r\\nYour ancestors skinned him alive, and I am an orphan. Not one drop of\\r\\nmy blood flows in that Indian’s veins today. I stand here, lone and\\r\\nforlorn, without an ancestor. They skinned him! I do not object to that,\\r\\nif they needed his fur; but alive, gentlemen--alive! They skinned him\\r\\nalive—and before company! That is what rankles. Think how he must have\\r\\nfelt; for he was a sensitive person and easily embarrassed. If he had\\r\\nbeen a bird, it would have been all right, and no violence done to his\\r\\nfeelings, because he would have been considered “dressed.” But he\\r\\nwas not a bird, gentlemen, he was a man, and probably one of the most\\r\\nundressed men that ever was. I ask you to put yourselves in his place.\\r\\nI ask it as a favor; I ask it as a tardy act of justice; I ask it in the\\r\\ninterest of fidelity to the traditions of your ancestors; I ask it\\r\\nthat the world may contemplate, with vision unobstructed by disguising\\r\\nswallow-tails and white cravats, the spectacle which the true New\\r\\nEngland Society ought to present. Cease to come to these annual orgies\\r\\nin this hollow modern mockery—the surplusage of raiment. Come in\\r\\ncharacter; come in the summer grace, come in the unadorned simplicity,\\r\\ncome in the free and joyous costume which your sainted ancestors\\r\\nprovided for mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater ancestors of mine were the Quakers William Robinson, Marmaduke\\r\\nStevenson, et al. Your tribe chased them out of the country for their\\r\\nreligion’s sake; promised them death if they came back; for your\\r\\nancestors had forsaken the homes they loved, and braved the perils of\\r\\nthe sea, the implacable climate, and the savage wilderness, to acquire\\r\\nthat highest and most precious of boons, freedom for every man on\\r\\nthis broad continent to worship according to the dictates of his own\\r\\nconscience—and they were not going to allow a lot of pestiferous\\r\\nQuakers to interfere with it. Your ancestors broke forever the chains\\r\\nof political slavery, and gave the vote to every man in this wide land,\\r\\nexcluding none!—none except those who did not belong to the orthodox\\r\\nchurch. Your ancestors—yes, they were a hard lot; but, nevertheless,\\r\\nthey gave us religious liberty to worship as they required us to\\r\\nworship, and political liberty to vote as the church required; and so\\r\\nI the bereft one, I the forlorn one, am here to do my best to help you\\r\\ncelebrate them right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quaker woman Elizabeth Hooton was an ancestress of mine. Your people\\r\\nwere pretty severe with her you will confess that. But, poor thing! I\\r\\nbelieve they changed her opinions before she died, and took her into\\r\\ntheir fold; and so we have every reason to presume that when she died\\r\\nshe went to the same place which your ancestors went to. It is a great\\r\\npity, for she was a good woman. Roger Williams was an ancestor of mine.\\r\\nI don’t really remember what your people did with him. But they banished\\r\\nhim to Rhode Island, anyway. And then, I believe, recognizing that this\\r\\nwas really carrying harshness to an unjustifiable extreme, they took\\r\\npity on him and burned him. They were a hard lot! All those Salem\\r\\nwitches were ancestors of mine! Your people made it tropical for them.\\r\\nYes, they did; by pressure and the gallows they made such a clean deal\\r\\nwith them that there hasn’t been a witch and hardly a halter in our\\r\\nfamily from that day to this, and that is one hundred and eighty-nine\\r\\nyears. The first slave brought into New England out of Africa by your\\r\\nprogenitors was an ancestor of mine—for I am of a mixed breed, an\\r\\ninfinitely shaded and exquisite Mongrel. I’m not one of your sham\\r\\nmeerschaums that you can color in a week. No, my complexion is the\\r\\npatient art of eight generations. Well, in my own time, I had acquired\\r\\na lot of my kin—by purchase, and swapping around, and one way and\\r\\nanother—and was getting along very well. Then, with the inborn\\r\\nperversity of your lineage, you got up a war, and took them all away\\r\\nfrom me. And so, again am I bereft, again am I forlorn; no drop of my\\r\\nblood flows in the veins of any living being who is marketable.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my friends, hear me and reform! I seek your good, not mine. You have\\r\\nheard the speeches. Disband these New England societies—nurseries of\\r\\na system of steadily augmenting laudation and hosannaing, which; if\\r\\npersisted in uncurbed, may some day in the remote future beguile you\\r\\ninto prevaricating and bragging. Oh, stop, stop, while you are still\\r\\ntemperate in your appreciation of your ancestors! Hear me, I beseech\\r\\nyou; get up an auction and sell Plymouth Rock! The Pilgrims were a\\r\\nsimple and ignorant race. They never had seen any good rocks before,\\r\\nor at least any that were not watched, and so they were excusable for\\r\\nhopping ashore in frantic delight and clapping an iron fence around this\\r\\none. But you, gentlemen, are educated; you are enlightened; you know\\r\\nthat in the rich land of your nativity, opulent New England, overflowing\\r\\nwith rocks, this one isn’t worth, at the outside, more than thirty-five\\r\\ncents. Therefore, sell it, before it is injured by exposure, or at least\\r\\nthrow it open to the patent-medicine advertisements, and let it earn its\\r\\ntaxes:\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, hear your true friend--your only true friend—list to his voice.\\r\\nDisband these societies, hotbeds of vice, of moral decay—perpetuators\\r\\nof ancestral superstition. Here on this board I see water, I see milk, I\\r\\nsee the wild and deadly lemonade. These are but steps upon the downward\\r\\npath. Next we shall see tea, then chocolate, then coffee—hotel coffee.\\r\\nA few more years—all too few, I fear—mark my words, we shall have cider!\\r\\nGentlemen, pause ere it be too late. You are on the broad road which\\r\\nleads to dissipation, physical ruin, moral decay, gory crime and the\\r\\ngallows! I beseech you, I implore you, in the name of your anxious\\r\\nfriends, in the name of your suffering families, in the name of your\\r\\nimpending widows and orphans, stop ere it be too late. Disband these New\\r\\nEngland societies, renounce these soul-blistering saturnalia, cease from\\r\\nvarnishing the rusty reputations of your long-vanished ancestors—the\\r\\nsuper-high-moral old iron-clads of Cape Cod, the pious buccaneers of\\r\\nPlymouth Rock—go home, and try to learn to behave!\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, chaff and nonsense aside, I think I honor and appreciate your\\r\\nPilgrim stock as much as you do yourselves, perhaps; and I endorse and\\r\\nadopt a sentiment uttered by a grandfather of mine once—a man of sturdy\\r\\nopinions, of sincere make of mind, and not given to flattery. He said:\\r\\n“People may talk as they like about that Pilgrim stock, but, after all’s\\r\\nsaid and done, it would be pretty hard to improve on those people; and,\\r\\nas for me, I don’t mind coming out flatfooted and saying there ain’t any\\r\\nway to improve on them—except having them born in Missouri!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPLIMENTS AND DEGREES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          DELIVERED AT THE LOTOS CLUB, JANUARY 11, 1908\\r\\n\\r\\n          In introducing Mr. Clemens, Frank R.  Lawrence, the President\\r\\n          of the Lotos Club, recalled the fact that the first club dinner\\r\\n          in the present club-house, some fourteen years ago, was in\\r\\n          honor of Mark Twain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish to begin this time at the beginning, lest I forget it altogether;\\r\\nthat is to say, I wish to thank you for this welcome that you are\\r\\ngiving, and the welcome which you gave me seven years ago, and which I\\r\\nforgot to thank you for at that time. I also wish to thank you for the\\r\\nwelcome you gave me fourteen years ago, which I also forgot to thank you\\r\\nfor at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you will continue this custom to give me a dinner every seven\\r\\nyears before I join the hosts in the other world—I do not know which\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Lawrence and Mr. Porter have paid me many compliments. It is very\\r\\ndifficult to take compliments. I do not care whether you deserve the\\r\\ncompliments or not, it is just as difficult to take them. The other\\r\\nnight I was at the Engineers’ Club, and enjoyed the sufferings of\\r\\nMr. Carnegie. They were complimenting him there; there it was all\\r\\ncompliments, and none of them deserved. They say that you cannot live by\\r\\nbread alone, but I can live on compliments.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not make any pretence that I dislike compliments. The stronger the\\r\\nbetter, and I can manage to digest them. I think I have lost so much by\\r\\nnot making a collection of compliments, to put them away and take them\\r\\nout again once in a while. When in England I said that I would start to\\r\\ncollect compliments, and I began there and I have brought some of them\\r\\nalong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first one of these lies—I wrote them down and preserved them—I think\\r\\nthey are mighty good and extremely just. It is one of Hamilton Mabie’s\\r\\ncompliments. He said that La Salle was the first one to make a voyage\\r\\nof the Mississippi, but Mark Twain was the first to chart, light, and\\r\\nnavigate it for the whole world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf that had been published at the time that I issued that book [Life on\\r\\nthe Mississippi], it would have been money in my pocket. I tell you, it\\r\\nis a talent by itself to pay compliments gracefully and have them ring\\r\\ntrue. It’s an art by itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is another compliment by Albert Bigelow Paine, my biographer. He\\r\\nis writing four octavo volumes about me, and he has been at my elbow two\\r\\nand one-half years.\\r\\n\\r\\nI just suppose that he does not know me, but says he knows me. He says\\r\\n“Mark Twain is not merely a great writer, a great philosopher, a great\\r\\nman; he is the supreme expression of the human being, with his strength\\r\\nand his weakness.” What a talent for compression! It takes a genius in\\r\\ncompression to compact as many facts as that.\\r\\n\\r\\nW. D. Howells spoke of me as first of Hartford, and ultimately of the\\r\\nsolar system, not to say of the universe:\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know how modest Howells is. If it can be proved that my fame reaches\\r\\nto Neptune and Saturn; that will satisfy even me. You know how modest\\r\\nand retiring Howells seems to be, but deep down he is as vain as I am.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Howells had been granted a degree at Oxford, whose gown was red. He\\r\\nhad been invited to an exercise at Columbia, and upon inquiry had been\\r\\ntold that it was usual to wear the black gown: Later he had found that\\r\\nthree other men wore bright gowns, and he had lamented that he had been\\r\\none of the black mass, and not a red torch.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdison wrote: “The average American loves his family. If he has any love\\r\\nleft over for some other person, he generally selects Mark Twain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow here’s the compliment of a little Montana girl which came to me\\r\\nindirectly. She was in a room in which there was a large photograph of\\r\\nme. After gazing at it steadily for a time, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve got a John the Baptist like that.” She also said: “Only ours has\\r\\nmore trimmings.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose she meant the halo. Now here is a gold-miner’s compliment. It\\r\\nis forty-two years old. It was my introduction to an audience to which\\r\\nI lectured in a log school-house. There were no ladies there. I wasn’t\\r\\nfamous then. They didn’t know me. Only the miners were there, with their\\r\\nbreeches tucked into their boottops and with clay all over them.\\r\\nThey wanted some one to introduce me, and they selected a miner, who\\r\\nprotested, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know anything about this man. Anyhow, I only know two things\\r\\nabout him. One is, he has never been in jail, and the other is, I don’t\\r\\nknow why.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s one thing I want to say about that English trip. I knew his\\r\\nMajesty the King of England long years ago, and I didn’t meet him for\\r\\nthe first time then. One thing that I regret was that some newspapers\\r\\nsaid I talked with the Queen of England with my hat on. I don’t do that\\r\\nwith any woman. I did not put it on until she asked me to. Then she told\\r\\nme to put it on, and it’s a command there. I thought I had carried my\\r\\nAmerican democracy far enough. So I put it on. I have no use for a hat,\\r\\nand never did have.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho was it who said that the police of London knew me? Why, the police\\r\\nknow me everywhere. There never was a day over there when a policeman\\r\\ndid not salute me, and then put up his hand and stop the traffic of the\\r\\nworld. They treated me as though I were a duchess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe happiest experience I had in England was at a dinner given in the\\r\\nbuilding of the Punch publication, a humorous paper which is appreciated\\r\\nby all Englishmen. It was the greatest privilege ever allowed a\\r\\nforeigner. I entered the dining-room of the building, where those men\\r\\nget together who have been running the paper for over fifty years. We\\r\\nwere about to begin dinner when the toastmaster said: “Just a minute;\\r\\nthere ought to be a little ceremony.” Then there was that meditating\\r\\nsilence for a while, and out of a closet there came a beautiful little\\r\\ngirl dressed in pink, holding in her hand a copy of the previous week’s\\r\\npaper, which had in it my cartoon. It broke me all up. I could not even\\r\\nsay “Thank you.” That was the prettiest incident of the dinner, the\\r\\ndelight of all that wonderful table. When she was about to go; I said,\\r\\n“My child, you are not going to leave me; I have hardly got acquainted\\r\\nwith you.” She replied, “You know I’ve got to go; they never let me come\\r\\nin here before, and they never will again.” That is one of the beautiful\\r\\nincidents that I cherish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     [At the conclusion of his speech, and while the diners were still\\r\\n     cheering him, Colonel Porter brought forward the red-and-gray gown\\r\\n     of the Oxford “doctor,” and Mr. Clemens was made to don it.\\r\\n     The diners rose to their feet in their enthusiasm. With the\\r\\n     mortar-board on his head, and looking down admiringly at himself,\\r\\n     Mr. Twain said--]\\r\\n\\r\\nI like that gown. I always did like red. The redder it is the better I\\r\\nlike it. I was born for a savage. Now, whoever saw any red like this?\\r\\nThere is no red outside the arteries of an archangel that could compare\\r\\nwith this. I know you all envy me. I am going to have luncheon shortly\\r\\nwith ladies just ladies. I will be the only lady of my sex present, and\\r\\nI shall put on this gown and make those ladies look dim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOKS, AUTHORS, AND HATS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE PILGRIMS’ CLUB LUNCHEON, GIVEN IN HONOR OF Mr.\\r\\n          CLEMENS AT THE SAVOY HOTEL, LONDON, JUNE 25, 1907.\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Birrell, M.P., Chief-Secretary for Ireland, in introducing\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens said: “We all love Mark Twain, and we are here to\\r\\n          tell him so.  One more point--all the world knows it, and that\\r\\n          is why it is dangerous to omit it--our guest is a distinguished\\r\\n          citizen of the Great Republic beyond the seas.  In America his\\r\\n          ‘Huckleberry Finn’ and his ‘Tom Sawyer’ are what ‘Robinson\\r\\n          Crusoe’ and ‘Tom Brown’s School Days’ have been to us.  They\\r\\n          are racy of the soil.  They are books to which it is impossible\\r\\n          to place any period of termination.  I will not speak of the\\r\\n          classics--reminiscences of much evil in our early lives.  We do\\r\\n          not meet here to-day as critics with our appreciations and\\r\\n          depreciations, our twopenny little prefaces or our forewords.\\r\\n          I am not going to say what the world a thousand years hence\\r\\n          will think of Mark Twain.  Posterity will take care of itself,\\r\\n          will read what it wants to read, will forget what it chooses to\\r\\n          forget, and will pay no attention whatsoever to our critical\\r\\n          mumblings and jumblings.  Let us therefore be content to say to\\r\\n          our friend and guest that we are here speaking for ourselves\\r\\n          and for our children, to say what he has been to us.  I\\r\\n          remember in Liverpool, in 1867, first buying the copy, which I\\r\\n          still preserve, of the celebrated ‘Jumping Frog.’  It had a few\\r\\n          words of preface which reminded me then that our guest in those\\r\\n          days was called ‘the wild humorist of the Pacific slope,’ and a\\r\\n          few lines later down, ‘the moralist of the Main.’  That was\\r\\n          some forty years ago.  Here he is, still the humorist, still\\r\\n          the moralist.  His humor enlivens and enlightens his morality,\\r\\n          and his morality is all the better for his humor.  That is one\\r\\n          of the reasons why we love him.  I am not here to mention any\\r\\n          book of his--that is a subject of dispute in my family circle,\\r\\n          which is the best and which is the next best--but I must put in\\r\\n          a word, lest I should not be true to myself--a terrible thing\\r\\n          --for his Joan of Arc, a book of chivalry, of nobility, and of\\r\\n          manly sincerity for which I take this opportunity of thanking\\r\\n          him.  But you can all drink this toast, each one of you with\\r\\n          his own intention.  You can get into it what meaning you like.\\r\\n          Mark Twain is a man whom English and Americans do well to\\r\\n          honor.  He is the true consolidator of nations.  His delightful\\r\\n          humor is of the kind which dissipates and destroys national\\r\\n          prejudices.  His truth and his honor, his love of truth, and\\r\\n          his love of honor, overflow all boundaries.  He has made the\\r\\n          world better by his presence.  We rejoice to see him here.\\r\\n          Long may he live to reap the plentiful harvest of hearty,\\r\\n          honest human affection!”\\r\\n\\r\\nPilgrims, I desire first to thank those undergraduates of Oxford. When\\r\\na man has grown so old as I am, when he has reached the verge of\\r\\nseventy-two years, there is nothing that carries him back to the\\r\\ndreamland of his life, to his boyhood, like recognition of those young\\r\\nhearts up yonder. And so I thank them out of my heart. I desire to thank\\r\\nthe Pilgrims of New York also for their kind notice and message which\\r\\nthey have cabled over here. Mr. Birrell says he does not know how he\\r\\ngot here. But he will be able to get away all right—he has not drunk\\r\\nanything since he came here. I am glad to know about those friends\\r\\nof his, Otway and Chatterton—fresh, new names to me. I am glad of the\\r\\ndisposition he has shown to rescue them from the evils of poverty, and\\r\\nif they are still in London, I hope to have a talk with them. For a\\r\\nwhile I thought he was going to tell us the effect which my book had\\r\\nupon his growing manhood. I thought he was going to tell us how much\\r\\nthat effect amounted to, and whether it really made him what he now is,\\r\\nbut with the discretion born of Parliamentary experience he dodged that,\\r\\nand we do not know now whether he read the book or not. He did that very\\r\\nneatly. I could not do it any better myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy books have had effects, and very good ones, too, here and there, and\\r\\nsome others not so good. There is no doubt about that. But I remember\\r\\none monumental instance of it years and years ago. Professor Norton, of\\r\\nHarvard, was over here, and when he came back to Boston I went out with\\r\\nHowells to call on him. Norton was allied in some way by marriage with\\r\\nDarwin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Norton was very gentle in what he had to say, and almost delicate,\\r\\nand he said: “Mr. Clemens, I have been spending some time with Mr.\\r\\nDarwin in England, and I should like to tell you something connected\\r\\nwith that visit. You were the object of it, and I myself would have\\r\\nbeen very proud of it, but you may not be proud of it. At any rate, I am\\r\\ngoing to tell you what it was, and to leave to you to regard it as you\\r\\nplease. Mr. Darwin took me up to his bedroom and pointed out certain\\r\\nthings there-pitcher-plants, and so on, that he was measuring and\\r\\nwatching from day to day—and he said: ‘The chambermaid is permitted to\\r\\ndo what she pleases in this room, but she must never touch those plants\\r\\nand never touch those books on that table by that candle. With those\\r\\nbooks I read myself to sleep every night.’ Those were your own books.”\\r\\n I said: “There is no question to my mind as to whether I should regard\\r\\nthat as a compliment or not. I do regard it as a very great compliment\\r\\nand a very high honor that that great mind, laboring for the whole human\\r\\nrace, should rest itself on my books. I am proud that he should read\\r\\nhimself to sleep with them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I could not keep that to myself—I was so proud of it. As soon as I\\r\\ngot home to Hartford I called up my oldest friend—and dearest enemy on\\r\\noccasion—the Rev. Joseph Twichell, my pastor, and I told him about that,\\r\\nand, of course, he was full of interest and venom. Those people who get\\r\\nno compliments like that feel like that. He went off. He did not issue\\r\\nany applause of any kind, and I did not hear of that subject for some\\r\\ntime. But when Mr. Darwin passed away from this life, and some time\\r\\nafter Darwin’s Life and Letters came out, the Rev. Mr. Twichell procured\\r\\nan early copy of that work and found something in it which he considered\\r\\napplied to me. He came over to my house—it was snowing, raining,\\r\\nsleeting, but that did not make any difference to Twichell. He produced\\r\\nthe book, and turned over and over, until he came to a certain place,\\r\\nwhen he said: “Here, look at this letter from Mr. Darwin to Sir Joseph\\r\\nHooker.” What Mr. Darwin said—I give you the idea and not the very\\r\\nwords—was this: I do not know whether I ought to have devoted my whole\\r\\nlife to these drudgeries in natural history and the other sciences or\\r\\nnot, for while I may have gained in one way I have lost in another. Once\\r\\nI had a fine perception and appreciation of high literature, but in me\\r\\nthat quality is atrophied. “That was the reason,” said Mr. Twichell, “he\\r\\nwas reading your books.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Birrell has touched lightly—very lightly, but in not an\\r\\nuncomplimentary way—on my position in this world as a moralist. I am\\r\\nglad to have that recognition, too, because I have suffered since I have\\r\\nbeen in this town; in the first place, right away, when I came here,\\r\\nfrom a newsman going around with a great red, highly displayed placard\\r\\nin the place of an apron. He was selling newspapers, and there were two\\r\\nsentences on that placard which would have been all right if they had\\r\\nbeen punctuated; but they ran those two sentences together without a\\r\\ncomma or anything, and that would naturally create a wrong impression,\\r\\nbecause it said, “Mark Twain arrives Ascot Cup stolen.” No doubt many a\\r\\nperson was misled by those sentences joined together in that unkind way.\\r\\nI have no doubt my character has suffered from it. I suppose I ought to\\r\\ndefend my character, but how can I defend it? I can say here and\\r\\nnow—and anybody can see by my face that I am sincere, that I speak the\\r\\ntruth—that I have never seen that Cup. I have not got the Cup—I did not\\r\\nhave a chance to get it. I have always had a good character in that way.\\r\\nI have hardly ever stolen anything, and if I did steal anything I had\\r\\ndiscretion enough to know about the value of it first. I do not steal\\r\\nthings that are likely to get myself into trouble. I do not think any of\\r\\nus do that. I know we all take things—that is to be expected—but really,\\r\\nI have never taken anything, certainly in England, that amounts to any\\r\\ngreat thing. I do confess that when I was here seven years ago I stole a\\r\\nhat, but that did not amount to anything. It was not a good hat, and was\\r\\nonly a clergyman’s hat, anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was at a luncheon party, and Archdeacon Wilberforce was there also. I\\r\\ndare say he is Archdeacon now—he was a canon then—and he was serving in\\r\\nthe Westminster battery, if that is the proper term—I do not know, as\\r\\nyou mix military and ecclesiastical things together so much. He left the\\r\\nluncheon table before I did. He began this. I did steal his hat, but\\r\\nhe began by taking mine. I make that interjection because I would not\\r\\naccuse Archdeacon Wilberforce of stealing my hat—I should not think of\\r\\nit. I confine that phrase to myself. He merely took my hat. And with\\r\\ngood judgment, too—it was a better hat than his. He came out before the\\r\\nluncheon was over, and sorted the hats in the hall, and selected one\\r\\nwhich suited. It happened to be mine. He went off with it. When I came\\r\\nout by-and-by there was no hat there which would go on my head except\\r\\nhis, which was left behind. My head was not the customary size just at\\r\\nthat time. I had been receiving a good many very nice and complimentary\\r\\nattentions, and my head was a couple of sizes larger than usual, and his\\r\\nhat just suited me. The bumps and corners were all right intellectually.\\r\\nThere were results pleasing to me—possibly so to him. He found out whose\\r\\nhat it was, and wrote me saying it was pleasant that all the way\\r\\nhome, whenever he met anybody his gravities, his solemnities, his deep\\r\\nthoughts, his eloquent remarks were all snatched up by the people he\\r\\nmet, and mistaken for brilliant humorisms.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had another experience. It was not unpleasing. I was received with a\\r\\ndeference which was entirely foreign to my experience by everybody whom\\r\\nI met, so that before I got home I had a much higher opinion of\\r\\nmyself than I have ever had before or since. And there is in that very\\r\\nconnection an incident which I remember at that old date which is rather\\r\\nmelancholy to me, because it shows how a person can deteriorate in a\\r\\nmere seven years. It is seven years ago. I have not that hat now. I\\r\\nwas going down Pall-Mall, or some other of your big streets, and I\\r\\nrecognized that that hat needed ironing. I went into a big shop\\r\\nand passed in my hat, and asked that it might be ironed. They were\\r\\ncourteous, very courteous, even courtly. They brought that hat back to\\r\\nme presently very sleek and nice, and I asked how much there was to\\r\\npay. They replied that they did not charge the clergy anything. I have\\r\\ncherished the delight of that moment from that day to this. It was the\\r\\nfirst thing I did the other day to go and hunt up that shop and hand in\\r\\nmy hat to have it ironed. I said when it came back, “How much to\\r\\npay?” They said, “Ninepence.” In seven years I have acquired all that\\r\\nworldliness, and I am sorry to be back where I was seven years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now I am chaffing and chaffing and chaffing here, and I hope\\r\\nyou will forgive me for that; but when a man stands on the verge of\\r\\nseventy-two you know perfectly well that he never reached that place\\r\\nwithout knowing what this life is—heart breaking bereavement. And so our\\r\\nreverence is for our dead. We do not forget them; but our duty is toward\\r\\nthe living; and if we can be cheerful, cheerful in spirit, cheerful in\\r\\nspeech and in hope, that is a benefit to those who are around us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy own history includes an incident which will always connect me with\\r\\nEngland in a pathetic way, for when I arrived here seven years ago with\\r\\nmy wife and my daughter—we had gone around the globe lecturing to raise\\r\\nmoney to clear off a debt—my wife and one of my daughters started across\\r\\nthe ocean to bring to England our eldest daughter. She was twenty\\r\\nfour years of age and in the bloom of young womanhood, and we were\\r\\nunsuspecting. When my wife and daughter—and my wife has passed from this\\r\\nlife since—when they had reached mid Atlantic, a cablegram—one of those\\r\\nheartbreaking cablegrams which we all in our days have to experience—was\\r\\nput into my hand. It stated that that daughter of ours had gone to her\\r\\nlong sleep. And so, as I say, I cannot always be cheerful, and I cannot\\r\\nalways be chaffing; I must sometimes lay the cap and bells aside, and\\r\\nrecognize that I am of the human race like the rest, and must have my\\r\\ncares and griefs. And therefore I noticed what Mr. Birrell said—I was so\\r\\nglad to hear him say it—something that was in the nature of these verses\\r\\nhere at the top of this:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n              “He lit our life with shafts of sun\\r\\n               And vanquished pain.\\r\\n               Thus two great nations stand as one\\r\\n               In honoring Twain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very glad to have those verses. I am very glad and very grateful\\r\\nfor what Mr. Birrell said in that connection. I have received since\\r\\nI have been here, in this one week, hundreds of letters from all\\r\\nconditions of people in England—men, women, and children—and there is in\\r\\nthem compliment, praise, and, above all and better than all, there is\\r\\nin them a note of affection. Praise is well, compliment is well, but\\r\\naffection—that is the last and final and most precious reward that any\\r\\nman can win, whether by character or achievement, and I am very grateful\\r\\nto have that reward. All these letters make me feel that here in\\r\\nEngland—as in America—when I stand under the English flag, I am not a\\r\\nstranger. I am not an alien, but at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEDICATION SPEECH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          AT THE DEDICATION OF THE COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK,\\r\\n          MAY 14, 1908\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens wore his gown as Doctor of Laws, Oxford University.\\r\\n          Ambassador Bryce and Mr. Choate had made the formal addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow difficult, indeed, is the higher education. Mr. Choate needs a\\r\\nlittle of it. He is not only short as a statistician of New York, but\\r\\nhe is off, far off, in his mathematics. The four thousand citizens of\\r\\nGreater New York, indeed!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I don’t think it was wise or judicious on the part of Mr. Choate to\\r\\nshow this higher education he has obtained. He sat in the lap of that\\r\\ngreat education (I was there at the time), and see the result—the\\r\\nlamentable result. Maybe if he had had a sandwich here to sustain him\\r\\nthe result would not have been so serious.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor seventy-two years I have been striving to acquire that higher\\r\\neducation which stands for modesty and diffidence, and it doesn’t work.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then look at Ambassador Bryce, who referred to his alma mater,\\r\\nOxford. He might just as well have included me. Well, I am a later\\r\\nproduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I am the latest graduate, I really and sincerely hope I am not the\\r\\nfinal flower of its seven centuries; I hope it may go on for seven ages\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDIE SCHRECKEN DER DEUTSCHEN SPRACHE [THE HORRORS OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS TO THE VIENNA PRESS CLUB, NOVEMBER 21, 1897,\\r\\n          DELIVERED IN GERMAN [Here in literal translation]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has me deeply touched, my gentlemen, here so hospitably received to\\r\\nbe. From colleagues out of my own profession, in this from my own home\\r\\nso far distant land. My heart is full of gratitude, but my poverty of\\r\\nGerman words forces me to greater economy of expression. Excuse you, my\\r\\ngentlemen, that I read off, what I you say will. [But he didn’t read].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German language speak I not good, but have numerous connoisseurs\\r\\nme assured that I her write like an angel. Maybe—maybe—I know not. Have\\r\\ntill now no acquaintance with the angels had. That comes later—when it\\r\\nthe dear God please—it has no hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince long, my gentlemen, have I the passionate longing nursed a speech\\r\\non German to hold, but one has me not permitted. Men, who no feeling\\r\\nfor the art had, laid me ever hindrance in the way and made naught my\\r\\ndesire—sometimes by excuses, often by force. Always said these men to\\r\\nme: “Keep you still, your Highness! Silence! For God’s sake seek another\\r\\nway and means yourself obnoxious to make.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the present case, as usual it is me difficult become, for me the\\r\\npermission to obtain. The committee sorrowed deeply, but could me\\r\\nthe permission not grant on account of a law which from the Concordia\\r\\ndemands she shall the German language protect. Du liebe Zeit! How so\\r\\nhad one to me this say could—might—dared—should? I am indeed the truest\\r\\nfriend of the German language—and not only now, but from long since—yes,\\r\\nbefore twenty years already. And never have I the desire had the noble\\r\\nlanguage to hurt; to the contrary, only wished she to improve—I would\\r\\nher only reform. It is the dream of my life been. I have already visits\\r\\nby the various German governments paid and for contracts prayed. I am\\r\\nnow to Austria in the same task come. I would only some changes effect.\\r\\nI would only the language method—the luxurious, elaborate construction\\r\\ncompress, the eternal parenthesis suppress, do away with, annihilate;\\r\\nthe introduction of more than thirteen subjects in one sentence forbid;\\r\\nthe verb so far to the front pull that one it without a telescope\\r\\ndiscover can. With one word, my gentlemen, I would your beloved language\\r\\nsimplify so that, my gentlemen, when you her for prayer need, One her\\r\\nyonder-up understands.\\r\\n\\r\\nI beseech you, from me yourself counsel to let, execute these mentioned\\r\\nreforms. Then will you an elegant language possess, and afterward, when\\r\\nyou some thing say will, will you at least yourself understand what you\\r\\nsaid had. But often nowadays, when you a mile-long sentence from you\\r\\ngiven and you yourself somewhat have rested, then must you have a\\r\\ntouching inquisitiveness have yourself to determine what you actually\\r\\nspoken have. Before several days has the correspondent of a local paper\\r\\na sentence constructed which hundred and twelve words contain, and\\r\\ntherein were seven parentheses smuggled in, and the subject seven times\\r\\nchanged. Think you only, my gentlemen, in the course of the voyage of a\\r\\nsingle sentence must the poor, persecuted, fatigued subject seven times\\r\\nchange position!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when we the mentioned reforms execute, will it no longer so bad\\r\\nbe. Doch noch eins. I might gladly the separable verb also a little bit\\r\\nreform. I might none do let what Schiller did: he has the whole history\\r\\nof the Thirty Years’ War between the two members of a separable verb\\r\\nin-pushed. That has even Germany itself aroused, and one has Schiller\\r\\nthe permission refused the History of the Hundred Years’ War to\\r\\ncompose—God be it thanked! After all these reforms established be will,\\r\\nwill the German language the noblest and the prettiest on the world be.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince to you now, my gentlemen, the character of my mission known is,\\r\\nbeseech I you so friendly to be and to me your valuable help grant. Mr.\\r\\nPotzl has the public believed make would that I to Vienna come am\\r\\nin order the bridges to clog up and the traffic to hinder, while I\\r\\nobservations gather and note. Allow you yourselves but not from him\\r\\ndeceived. My frequent presence on the bridges has an entirely innocent\\r\\nground. Yonder gives it the necessary space, yonder can one a noble\\r\\nlong German sentence elaborate, the bridge-railing along, and his whole\\r\\ncontents with one glance overlook. On the one end of the railing pasted\\r\\nI the first member of a separable verb and the final member cleave I\\r\\nto the other end—then spread the body of the sentence between it out!\\r\\nUsually are for my purposes the bridges of the city long enough; when I\\r\\nbut Potzl’s writings study will I ride out and use the glorious endless\\r\\nimperial bridge. But this is a calumny; Potzl writes the prettiest\\r\\nGerman. Perhaps not so pliable as the mine, but in many details much\\r\\nbetter. Excuse you these flatteries. These are well deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I my speech execute—no, I would say I bring her to the close. I am\\r\\na foreigner—but here, under you, have I it entirely forgotten. And so\\r\\nagain and yet again proffer I you my heartiest thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGERMAN FOR THE HUNGARIANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE JUBILEE CELEBRATION OF THE EMANCIPATION OF THE\\r\\n          HUNGARIAN PRESS,  MARCH 26, 1899\\r\\n\\r\\n          The Ministry and members of Parliament were present.  The\\r\\n          subject was the “Ausgleich”--i. e., the arrangement for the\\r\\n          apportionment of the taxes between Hungary and Austria.\\r\\n          Paragraph 14 of the ausgleich fixes the proportion each country\\r\\n          must pay to the support of the army.  It is the paragraph which\\r\\n          caused the trouble and prevented its renewal.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that we are all here together, I think it will be a good idea to\\r\\narrange the ausgleich. If you will act for Hungary I shall be quite\\r\\nwilling to act for Austria, and this is the very time for it. There\\r\\ncouldn’t be a better, for we are all feeling friendly, fair-minded,\\r\\nand hospitable now, and, full of admiration for each other, full of\\r\\nconfidence in each other, full of the spirit of welcome, full of the\\r\\ngrace of forgiveness, and the disposition to let bygones be bygones.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us not waste this golden, this beneficent, this providential\\r\\nopportunity. I am willing to make any concession you want, just so we\\r\\nget it settled. I am not only willing to let grain come in free, I am\\r\\nwilling to pay the freight on it, and you may send delegates to the\\r\\nReichsrath if you like. All I require is that they shall be quiet,\\r\\npeaceable people like your own deputies, and not disturb our\\r\\nproceedings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want the Gegenseitigengeldbeitragendenverhaltnismassigkeiten\\r\\nrearranged and readjusted I am ready for that. I will let you off at\\r\\ntwenty-eight per cent.—twenty-seven—even twenty-five if you insist,\\r\\nfor there is nothing illiberal about me when I am out on a diplomatic\\r\\ndebauch.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in return for these concessions, I am willing to take anything\\r\\nin reason, and I think we may consider the business settled and the\\r\\nausgleich ausgegloschen at last for ten solid years, and we will sign\\r\\nthe papers in blank, and do it here and now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I am unspeakably glad to have that ausgleich off my hands. It has\\r\\nkept me awake nights for anderthalbjahr.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I never could settle it before, because always when I called at the\\r\\nForeign Office in Vienna to talk about it, there wasn’t anybody at home,\\r\\nand that is not a place where you can go in and see for yourself whether\\r\\nit is a mistake or not, because the person who takes care of the front\\r\\ndoor there is of a size that discourages liberty of action and the free\\r\\nspirit of investigation. To think the ausgleich is abgemacht at last! It\\r\\nis a grand and beautiful consummation, and I am glad I came.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way I feel now I do honestly believe I would rather be just my own\\r\\nhumble self at this moment than paragraph 14.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA NEW GERMAN WORD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          To aid a local charity Mr. Clemens appeared before a\\r\\n          fashionable audience in Vienna, March 10, 1899, reading his\\r\\n          sketch “The Lucerne Girl,” and describing how he had been\\r\\n          interviewed and ridiculed.  He said in part:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not sufficiently mastered German, to allow my using it with\\r\\nimpunity. My collection of fourteen-syllable German words is still\\r\\nincomplete. But I have just added to that collection a jewel—a veritable\\r\\njewel. I found it in a telegram from Linz, and it contains ninety-five\\r\\nletters:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonaleinkommensteuerschatzungskommissionsmitgliedsreisekostenrechnungs\\r\\nerganzungsrevisionsfund\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I could get a similar word engraved upon my tombstone I should sleep\\r\\nbeneath it in peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUNCONSCIOUS PLAGIARISM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          DELIVERED AT THE DINNER GIVEN BY THE PUBLISHERS OF “THE\\r\\n          ATLANTIC MONTHLY” TO OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, IN HONOR OF HIS\\r\\n          SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY, AUGUST 29, 1879\\r\\n\\r\\nI would have travelled a much greater distance than I have come to\\r\\nwitness the paying of honors to Doctor Holmes; for my feeling toward him\\r\\nhas always been one of peculiar warmth. When one receives a letter from\\r\\na great man for the first time in his life, it is a large event to him,\\r\\nas all of you know by your own experience. You never can receive letters\\r\\nenough from famous men afterward to obliterate that one, or dim the\\r\\nmemory of the pleasant surprise it was, and the gratification it gave\\r\\nyou. Lapse of time cannot make it commonplace or cheap.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, the first great man who ever wrote me a letter was our\\r\\nguest—Oliver Wendell Holmes. He was also the first great literary man I\\r\\never stole anything from—and that is how I came to write to him and he\\r\\nto me. When my first book was new, a friend of mine said to me, “The\\r\\ndedication is very neat.” Yes, I said, I thought it was. My friend said,\\r\\n“I always admired it, even before I saw it in The Innocents Abroad.” I\\r\\nnaturally said: “What do you mean? Where did you ever see it before?”\\r\\n “Well, I saw it first some years ago as Doctor Holmes’s dedication to\\r\\nhis Songs in Many Keys.” Of course, my first impulse was to prepare this\\r\\nman’s remains for burial, but upon reflection I said I would reprieve\\r\\nhim for a moment or two and give him a chance to prove his assertion\\r\\nif he could: We stepped into a book-store, and he did prove it. I had\\r\\nreally stolen that dedication, almost word for word. I could not imagine\\r\\nhow this curious thing had happened; for I knew one thing—that a certain\\r\\namount of pride always goes along with a teaspoonful of brains, and\\r\\nthat this pride protects a man from deliberately stealing other people’s\\r\\nideas. That is what a teaspoonful of brains will do for a man—and\\r\\nadmirers had often told me I had nearly a basketful—though they were\\r\\nrather reserved as to the size of the basket.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I thought the thing out, and solved the mystery. Two years\\r\\nbefore, I had been laid up a couple of weeks in the Sandwich Islands,\\r\\nand had read and re-read Doctor Holmes’s poems till my mental reservoir\\r\\nwas filled up with them to the brim. The dedication lay on the top, and\\r\\nhandy, so, by-and-by, I unconsciously stole it. Perhaps I unconsciously\\r\\nstole the rest of the volume, too, for many people have told me that\\r\\nmy book was pretty poetical, in one way or another. Well, of course, I\\r\\nwrote Doctor Holmes and told him I hadn’t meant to steal, and he wrote\\r\\nback and said in the kindest way that it was all right and no harm\\r\\ndone; and added that he believed we all unconsciously worked over ideas\\r\\ngathered in reading and hearing, imagining they were original with\\r\\nourselves. He stated a truth, and did it in such a pleasant way, and\\r\\nsalved over my sore spot so gently and so healingly, that I was rather\\r\\nglad I had committed the crime for the sake of the letter. I afterward\\r\\ncalled on him and told him to make perfectly free with any ideas of mine\\r\\nthat struck him as being good protoplasm for poetry. He could see by\\r\\nthat that there wasn’t anything mean about me; so we got along right\\r\\nfrom the start. I have not met Doctor Holmes many times since; and\\r\\nlately he said—However, I am wandering wildly away from the one thing\\r\\nwhich I got on my feet to do; that is, to make my compliments to you, my\\r\\nfellow-teachers of the great public, and likewise to say that I am\\r\\nright glad to see that Doctor Holmes is still in his prime and full of\\r\\ngenerous life; and as age is not determined by years, but by trouble\\r\\nand infirmities of mind and body, I hope it may be a very long time yet\\r\\nbefore any one can truthfully say, “He is growing old.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEATHER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY’S SEVENTY FIRST\\r\\n          ANNUAL DINNER, NEW YORK CITY\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next toast was: “The Oldest Inhabitant-The Weather of New England.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                   “Who can lose it and forget it?\\r\\n                    Who can have it and regret it?\\r\\n                    Be interposer ‘twixt us Twain.”\\r\\n                                         --Merchant of Venice.\\r\\n\\r\\nI reverently believe that the Maker who made us all makes everything in\\r\\nNew England but the weather. I don’t know who makes that, but I think\\r\\nit must be raw apprentices in the weather-clerk’s factory who experiment\\r\\nand learn how, in New England, for board and clothes, and then are\\r\\npromoted to make weather for countries that require a good article,\\r\\nand will take their custom elsewhere if they don’t get it. There is\\r\\na sumptuous variety about the New England weather that compels the\\r\\nstranger’s admiration—and regret. The weather is always doing something\\r\\nthere; always attending strictly to business; always getting up new\\r\\ndesigns and trying them on the people to see how they will go. But it\\r\\ngets through more business in spring than in any other season. In the\\r\\nspring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds of\\r\\nweather inside of four-and-twenty hours. It was I that made the fame and\\r\\nfortune of that man that had that marvellous collection of weather on\\r\\nexhibition at the Centennial, that so astounded the foreigners. He\\r\\nwas going to travel all over the world and get specimens from all the\\r\\nclimes. I said, “Don’t you do it; you come to New England on a favorable\\r\\nspring day.” I told him what we could do in the way of style, variety,\\r\\nand quantity. Well, he came and he made his collection in four days. As\\r\\nto variety, why, he confessed that he got hundreds of kinds of weather\\r\\nthat he had never heard of before. And as to quantity well, after he had\\r\\npicked out and discarded all that was blemished in any way, he not only\\r\\nhad weather enough, but weather to spare; weather to hire out; weather\\r\\nto sell; to deposit; weather to invest; weather to give to the poor. The\\r\\npeople of New England are by nature patient and forbearing, but there\\r\\nare some things which they will not stand. Every year they kill a lot of\\r\\npoets for writing about “Beautiful Spring.” These are generally casual\\r\\nvisitors, who bring their notions of spring from somewhere else, and\\r\\ncannot, of course, know how the natives feel about spring. And so the\\r\\nfirst thing they know the opportunity to inquire how they feel has\\r\\npermanently gone by. Old Probabilities has a mighty reputation for\\r\\naccurate prophecy, and thoroughly well deserves it. You take up the\\r\\npaper and observe how crisply and confidently he checks off what\\r\\nto-day’s weather is going to be on the Pacific, down South, in the\\r\\nMiddle States, in the Wisconsin region. See him sail along in the joy\\r\\nand pride of his power till he gets to New England, and then see his\\r\\ntail drop. He doesn’t know what the weather is going to be in New\\r\\nEngland. Well, he mulls over it, and by and-by he gets out something\\r\\nabout like this: Probably northeast to southwest winds, varying to the\\r\\nsouthward and westward and eastward, and points between, high and low\\r\\nbarometer swapping around from place to place; probable areas of rain,\\r\\nsnow, hail, and drought, succeeded or preceded by earthquakes, with\\r\\nthunder and lightning. Then he jots down his postscript from his\\r\\nwandering mind, to cover accidents. “But it is possible that the\\r\\nprogramme may be wholly changed in the mean time.” Yes, one of the\\r\\nbrightest gems in the New England weather is the dazzling uncertainty of\\r\\nit. There is only one thing certain about it: you are certain there is\\r\\ngoing to be plenty of it—a perfect grand review; but you never can tell\\r\\nwhich end of the procession is going to move first. You fix up for the\\r\\ndrought; you leave your umbrella in the house and sally out, and two to\\r\\none you get drowned. You make up your mind that the earthquake is due;\\r\\nyou stand from under, and take hold of something to steady yourself, and\\r\\nthe first thing you know you get struck by lightning. These are great\\r\\ndisappointments; but they can’t be helped. The lightning there is\\r\\npeculiar; it is so convincing, that when it strikes a thing it doesn’t\\r\\nleave enough of that thing behind for you to tell whether—Well, you’d\\r\\nthink it was something valuable, and a Congressman had been there. And\\r\\nthe thunder. When the thunder begins to merely tune up and scrape and\\r\\nsaw, and key up the instruments for the performance, strangers say,\\r\\n“Why, what awful thunder you have here!” But when the baton is raised\\r\\nand the real concert begins, you’ll find that stranger down in the\\r\\ncellar with his head in the ash-barrel. Now as to the size of the\\r\\nweather in New England—lengthways, I mean. It is utterly disproportioned\\r\\nto the size of that little country. Half the time, when it is packed as\\r\\nfull as it can stick, you will see that New England weather sticking out\\r\\nbeyond the edges and projecting around hundreds and hundreds of miles\\r\\nover the neighboring States. She can’t hold a tenth part of her weather.\\r\\nYou can see cracks all about where she has strained herself trying to\\r\\ndo it. I could speak volumes about the inhuman perversity of the New\\r\\nEngland weather, but I will give but a single specimen. I like to hear\\r\\nrain on a tin roof. So I covered part of my roof with tin, with an eye\\r\\nto that luxury. Well, sir, do you think it ever rains on that tin? No,\\r\\nsir; skips it every time. Mind, in this speech I have been trying merely\\r\\nto do honor to the New England weather—no language could do it justice.\\r\\nBut, after all, there is at least one or two things about that weather\\r\\n(or, if you please, effects produced by it) which we residents would not\\r\\nlike to part with. If we hadn’t our bewitching autumn foliage, we should\\r\\nstill have to credit the weather with one feature which compensates for\\r\\nall its bullying vagaries—the ice-storm: when a leafless tree is clothed\\r\\nwith ice from the bottom to the top—ice that is as bright and clear\\r\\nas crystal; when every bough and twig is strung with ice-beads, frozen\\r\\ndew-drops, and the whole tree sparkles cold and white, like the Shah\\r\\nof Persia’s diamond plume. Then the wind waves the branches and the sun\\r\\ncomes out and turns all those myriads of beads and drops to prisms that\\r\\nglow and burn and flash with all manner of colored fires, which change\\r\\nand change again with inconceivable rapidity from blue to red, from red\\r\\nto green, and green to gold—the tree becomes a spraying fountain, a very\\r\\nexplosion of dazzling jewels; and it stands there the acme, the\\r\\nclimax, the supremest possibility in art or nature, of bewildering,\\r\\nintoxicating, intolerable magnificence. One cannot make the words too\\r\\nstrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BABIES\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BABIES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          DELIVERED AT THE BANQUET, IN CHICAGO, GIVEN BY THE ARMY OF THE\\r\\n          TENNESSEE TO THEIR FIRST COMMANDER, GENERAL U. S. GRANT,\\r\\n          NOVEMBER, 1879\\r\\n\\r\\n          The fifteenth regular toast was “The Babies.--As they comfort\\r\\n          us in our sorrows, let us not forget them in our festivities.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI like that. We have not all had the good fortune to be ladies. We have\\r\\nnot all been generals, or poets, or statesmen; but when the toast works\\r\\ndown to the babies, we stand on common ground. It is a shame that for a\\r\\nthousand years the world’s banquets have utterly ignored the baby, as if\\r\\nhe didn’t amount to anything. If you will stop and think a minute—if you\\r\\nwill go back fifty or one hundred years to your early married life and\\r\\nrecontemplate your first baby—you will remember that he amounted to a\\r\\ngood deal, and even something over. You soldiers all know that when that\\r\\nlittle fellow arrived at family headquarters you had to hand in your\\r\\nresignation. He took entire command. You became his lackey, his mere\\r\\nbody-servant, and you had to stand around too. He was not a commander\\r\\nwho made allowances for time, distance, weather, or anything else. You\\r\\nhad to execute his order whether it was possible or not. And there was\\r\\nonly one form of marching in his manual of tactics, and that was\\r\\nthe double-quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence and\\r\\ndisrespect, and the bravest of you didn’t dare to say a word. You could\\r\\nface the death-storm at Donelson and Vicksburg, and give back blow\\r\\nfor blow; but when he clawed your whiskers, and pulled your hair, and\\r\\ntwisted your nose, you had to take it. When the thunders of war were\\r\\nsounding in your ears you set your faces toward the batteries, and\\r\\nadvanced with steady tread; but when he turned on the terrors of his\\r\\nwar whoop you advanced in the other direction, and mighty glad of the\\r\\nchance, too. When he called for soothing-syrup, did you venture to throw\\r\\nout any side-remarks about certain services being unbecoming an officer\\r\\nand a gentleman? No. You got up and got it. When he ordered his pap\\r\\nbottle and it was not warm, did you talk back? Not you. You went to work\\r\\nand warmed it. You even descended so far in your menial office as to\\r\\ntake a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to see if it was\\r\\nright—three parts water to one of milk, a touch of sugar to modify the\\r\\ncolic, and a drop of peppermint to kill those immortal hiccoughs. I can\\r\\ntaste that stuff yet. And how many things you learned as you went along!\\r\\nSentimental young folks still take stock in that beautiful old saying\\r\\nthat when the baby smiles in his sleep, it is because the angels are\\r\\nwhispering to him. Very pretty, but too thin—simply wind on the stomach,\\r\\nmy friends. If the baby proposed to take a walk at his usual hour, two\\r\\no’clock in the morning, didn’t you rise up promptly and remark, with a\\r\\nmental addition which would not improve a Sunday-school book much, that\\r\\nthat was the very thing you were about to propose yourself? Oh! you were\\r\\nunder good discipline, and as you went fluttering up and down the room\\r\\nin your undress uniform, you not only prattled undignified baby-talk,\\r\\nbut even tuned up your martial voices and tried to sing!—Rock a-by\\r\\nBaby in the Tree-top, for instance. What a spectacle for an Army of the\\r\\nTennessee! And what an affliction for the neighbors, too; for it is not\\r\\neverybody within a mile around that likes military music at three in\\r\\nthe morning. And, when you had been keeping this sort of thing up two or\\r\\nthree hours, and your little velvet head intimated that nothing suited\\r\\nhim like exercise and noise, what did you do? You simply went on until\\r\\nyou dropped in the last ditch. The idea that a baby doesn’t amount to\\r\\nanything! Why, one baby is just a house and a front yard full by itself.\\r\\nOne baby can furnish more business than you and your whole Interior\\r\\nDepartment can attend to. He is enterprising, irrepressible, brimful of\\r\\nlawless activities. Do what you please, you can’t make him stay on the\\r\\nreservation. Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long as you are\\r\\nin your right mind don’t you ever pray for twins. Twins amount to a\\r\\npermanent riot. And there ain’t any real difference between triplets and\\r\\nan insurrection.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, it was high time for a toast-master to recognize the importance\\r\\nof the babies. Think what is in store for the present crop! Fifty years\\r\\nfrom now we shall all be dead, I trust, and then this flag, if it still\\r\\nsurvive (and let us hope it may), will be floating over a Republic\\r\\nnumbering 200,000,000 souls, according to the settled laws of our\\r\\nincrease. Our present schooner of State will have grown into a political\\r\\nleviathan—a Great Eastern. The cradled babies of to-day will be on deck.\\r\\nLet them be well trained, for we are going to leave a big contract on\\r\\ntheir hands. Among the three or four million cradles now rocking in\\r\\nthe land are some which this nation would preserve for ages as sacred\\r\\nthings, if we could know which ones they are. In one of these cradles\\r\\nthe unconscious Farragut of the future is at this moment teething—think\\r\\nof it! and putting in a world of dead earnest, unarticulated, but\\r\\nperfectly justifiable profanity over it, too. In another the future\\r\\nrenowned astronomer is blinking at the shining Milky Way with but a\\r\\nlanguid interest poor little chap!—and wondering what has become of that\\r\\nother one they call the wet-nurse. In another the future great historian\\r\\nis lying—and doubtless will continue to lie until his earthly mission\\r\\nis ended. In another the future President is busying himself with no\\r\\nprofounder problem of state than what the mischief has become of his\\r\\nhair so early; and in a mighty array of other cradles there are now some\\r\\n60,000 future office-seekers, getting ready to furnish him occasion to\\r\\ngrapple with that same old problem a second time. And in still one\\r\\nmore cradle, some where under the flag, the future illustrious\\r\\ncommander-in-chief of the American armies is so little burdened with\\r\\nhis approaching grandeurs and responsibilities as to be giving his whole\\r\\nstrategic mind at this moment to trying to find out some way to get his\\r\\nbig toe into his mouth—an achievement which, meaning no disrespect, the\\r\\nillustrious guest of this evening turned his entire attention to some\\r\\nfifty-six years ago; and if the child is but a prophecy of the man,\\r\\nthere are mighty few who will doubt that he succeeded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOUR CHILDREN AND GREAT DISCOVERIES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          DELIVERED AT THE AUTHORS’ CLUB, NEW YORK\\r\\n\\r\\nOur children—yours—and—mine. They seem like little things to talk\\r\\nabout—our children, but little things often make up the sum of human\\r\\nlife—that’s a good sentence. I repeat it, little things often produce\\r\\ngreat things. Now, to illustrate, take Sir Isaac Newton—I presume some\\r\\nof you have heard of Mr. Newton. Well, once when Sir Isaac Newton—a mere\\r\\nlad—got over into the man’s apple orchard—I don’t know what he was doing\\r\\nthere—I didn’t come all the way from Hartford to q-u-e-s-t-i-o-n Mr.\\r\\nNewton’s honesty—but when he was there—in the main orchard—he saw\\r\\nan apple fall and he was a-t-t-racted toward it, and that led to the\\r\\ndiscovery—not of Mr. Newton but of the great law of attraction and\\r\\ngravitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there was once another great discoverer—I’ve forgotten his name, and\\r\\nI don’t remember what he discovered, but I know it was something very\\r\\nimportant, and I hope you will all tell your children about it when you\\r\\nget home. Well, when the great discoverer was once loafn’ around down in\\r\\nVirginia, and a-puttin’ in his time flirting with Pocahontas—oh! Captain\\r\\nJohn Smith, that was the man’s name—and while he and Poca were sitting\\r\\nin Mr. Powhatan’s garden, he accidentally put his arm around her and\\r\\npicked something—a simple weed, which proved to be tobacco—and now we\\r\\nfind it in every Christian family, shedding its civilizing influence\\r\\nbroadcast throughout the whole religious community.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there was another great man, I can’t think of his name either, who\\r\\nused to loaf around and watch the great chandelier in the cathedral at\\r\\nPisa., which set him to thinking about the great law of gunpowder, and\\r\\neventually led to the discovery of the cotton-gin.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I don’t say this as an inducement for our young men to loaf around\\r\\nlike Mr. Newton and Mr. Galileo and Captain Smith, but they were once\\r\\nlittle babies two days old, and they show what little things have\\r\\nsometimes accomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEDUCATING THEATRE-GOERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          The children of the Educational Alliance gave a performance of\\r\\n          “The Prince and the Pauper” on the afternoon of April 14, 1907,\\r\\n          in the theatre of the Alliance Building in East Broadway.  The\\r\\n          audience was composed of nearly one thousand children of the\\r\\n          neighborhood.  Mr. Clemens, Mr. Howells, and Mr. Daniel Frohman\\r\\n          were among the invited guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not enjoyed a play so much, so heartily, and so thoroughly since\\r\\nI played Miles Hendon twenty-two years ago. I used to play in this piece\\r\\n(“The Prince and the Pauper”) with my children, who, twenty-two years\\r\\nago, were little youngsters. One of my daughters was the Prince, and a\\r\\nneighbor’s daughter was the Pauper, and the children of other neighbors\\r\\nplayed other parts. But we never gave such a performance as we have seen\\r\\nhere to-day. It would have been beyond us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy late wife was the dramatist and stage-manager. Our coachman was the\\r\\nstage-manager, second in command. We used to play it in this simple way,\\r\\nand the one who used to bring in the crown on a cushion—he was a little\\r\\nfellow then—is now a clergyman way up high—six or seven feet high—and\\r\\ngrowing higher all the time. We played it well, but not as well as you\\r\\nsee it here, for you see it done by practically trained professionals.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was especially interested in the scene which we have just had, for\\r\\nMiles Hendon was my part. I did it as well as a person could who never\\r\\nremembered his part. The children all knew their parts. They did not\\r\\nmind if I did not know mine. I could thread a needle nearly as well as\\r\\nthe player did whom you saw to-day. The words of my part I could supply\\r\\non the spot. The words of the song that Miles Hendon sang here I did not\\r\\ncatch. But I was great in that song.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          [Then Mr. Clemens hummed a bit of doggerel that the reporter\\r\\n          made out as this:\\r\\n\\r\\n                   “There was a woman in her town,\\r\\n                    She loved her husband well,\\r\\n                    But another man just twice as well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n          “How is that?” demanded Mr. Clemens.  Then resuming]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was so fresh and enjoyable to make up a new set of words each time\\r\\nthat I played the part.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had a thousand citizens in front of me, I would like to give them\\r\\ninformation, but you children already know all that I have found out\\r\\nabout the Educational Alliance. It’s like a man living within thirty\\r\\nmiles of Vesuvius and never knowing about a volcano. It’s like living\\r\\nfor a lifetime in Buffalo, eighteen miles from Niagara, and never going\\r\\nto see the Falls. So I had lived in New York and knew nothing about the\\r\\nEducational Alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis theatre is a part of the work, and furnishes pure and clean plays.\\r\\nThis theatre is an influence. Everything in the world is accomplished by\\r\\ninfluences which train and educate. When you get to be seventy-one and a\\r\\nhalf, as I am, you may think that your education is over, but it isn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we had forty theatres of this kind in this city of four millions,\\r\\nhow they would educate and elevate! We should have a body of educated\\r\\ntheatre-goers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would make better citizens, honest citizens. One of the best gifts a\\r\\nmillionaire could make would be a theatre here and a theatre there. It\\r\\nwould make of you a real Republic, and bring about an educational level.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EDUCATIONAL THEATRE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          On November 19, 1907, Mr. Clemens entertained a party of six or\\r\\n          seven hundred of his friends, inviting them to witness the\\r\\n          representation of “The Prince and the Pauper,” played by boys\\r\\n          and girls of the East Side at the Children’s Educational\\r\\n          Theatre, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust a word or two to let you know how deeply I appreciate the honor\\r\\nwhich the children who are the actors and frequenters of this cozy\\r\\nplayhouse have conferred upon me. They have asked me to be their\\r\\nambassador to invite the hearts and brains of New York to come down here\\r\\nand see the work they are doing. I consider it a grand distinction to be\\r\\nchosen as their intermediary. Between the children and myself there is\\r\\nan indissoluble bond of friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am proud of this theatre and this performance—proud, because I am\\r\\nnaturally vain—vain of myself and proud of the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish we could reach more children at one time. I am glad to see that\\r\\nthe children of the East Side have turned their backs on the Bowery\\r\\ntheatres to come to see the pure entertainments presented here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Children’s Theatre is a great educational institution. I hope the\\r\\ntime will come when it will be part of every public school in the land.\\r\\nI may be pardoned in being vain. I was born vain, I guess. [At this\\r\\npoint the stage-manager’s whistle interrupted Mr. Clemens.] That settles\\r\\nit; there’s my cue to stop. I was to talk until the whistle blew, but it\\r\\nblew before I got started. It takes me longer to get started than most\\r\\npeople. I guess I was born at slow speed. My time is up, and if you’ll\\r\\nkeep quiet for two minutes I’ll tell you something about Miss Herts, the\\r\\nwoman who conceived this splendid idea. She is the originator and the\\r\\ncreator of this theatre. Educationally, this institution coins the gold\\r\\nof young hearts into external good.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          [On April 23, 1908, he spoke again at the same place]\\r\\n\\r\\nI will be strictly honest with you; I am only fit to be honorary\\r\\npresident. It is not to be expected that I should be useful as a real\\r\\npresident. But when it comes to things ornamental I, of course, have no\\r\\nobjection. There is, of course, no competition. I take it as a very real\\r\\ncompliment because there are thousands of children who have had a part\\r\\nin this request. It is promotion in truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a thing worth doing that is done here. You have seen the children\\r\\nplay. You saw how little Sally reformed her burglar. She could reform\\r\\nany burglar. She could reform me. This is the only school in which\\r\\ncan be taught the highest and most difficult lessons—morals. In other\\r\\nschools the way of teaching morals is revolting. Here the children who\\r\\ncome in thousands live through each part.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are terribly anxious for the villain to get his bullet, and that\\r\\nI take to be a humane and proper sentiment. They spend freely the ten\\r\\ncents that is not saved without a struggle. It comes out of the candy\\r\\nmoney, and the money that goes for chewing-gum and other necessaries of\\r\\nlife. They make the sacrifice freely. This is the only school which they\\r\\nare sorry to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPOETS AS POLICEMEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens was one of the speakers at the Lotos Club dinner to\\r\\n          Governor Odell, March 24, 1900.  The police problem was\\r\\n          referred to at length.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us abolish policemen who carry clubs and revolvers, and put in a\\r\\nsquad of poets armed to the teeth with poems on Spring and Love. I\\r\\nwould be very glad to serve as commissioner, not because I think I am\\r\\nespecially qualified, but because I am too tired to work and would like\\r\\nto take a rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowells would go well as my deputy. He is tired too, and needs a rest\\r\\nbadly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would start in at once to elevate, purify, and depopulate the\\r\\nred-light district. I would assign the most soulful poets to that\\r\\ndistrict, all heavily armed with their poems. Take Chauncey Depew as a\\r\\nsample. I would station them on the corners after they had rounded up\\r\\nall the depraved people of the district so they could not escape, and\\r\\nthen have them read from their poems to the poor unfortunates. The\\r\\nplan would be very effective in causing an emigration of the depraved\\r\\nelement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPUDD’NHEAD WILSON DRAMATIZED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          When Mr. Clemens arrived from Europe in 1895 one of the first\\r\\n          things he did was to see the dramatization of Pudd’nhead\\r\\n          Wilson.  The audience becoming aware of the fact that Mr.\\r\\n          Clemens was in the house called upon him for a speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever in my life have I been able to make a speech without preparation,\\r\\nand I assure you that this position in which I find myself is one\\r\\ntotally unexpected.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been hemmed in all day by William Dean Howells and other\\r\\nfrivolous persons, and I have been talking about everything in the world\\r\\nexcept that of which speeches are constructed. Then, too, seven days\\r\\non the water is not conducive to speech-making. I will only say that I\\r\\ncongratulate Mr. Mayhew; he has certainly made a delightful play out of\\r\\nmy rubbish. His is a charming gift. Confidentially I have always had\\r\\nan idea that I was well equipped to write plays, but I have never\\r\\nencountered a manager who has agreed with me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDALY THEATRE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT A DINNER AFTER THE ONE HUNDREDTH PERFORMANCE OF\\r\\n          “THE TAMING OF THE SHREW.”\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens made the following speech, which he incorporated\\r\\n          afterward in Following the Equator.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad to be here. This is the hardest theatre in New York to get\\r\\ninto, even at the front door. I never got in without hard work. I am\\r\\nglad we have got so far in at last. Two or three years ago I had an\\r\\nappointment to meet Mr. Daly on the stage of this theatre at eight\\r\\no’clock in the evening. Well, I got on a train at Hartford to come to\\r\\nNew York and keep the appointment. All I had to do was to come to the\\r\\nback door of the theatre on Sixth Avenue. I did not believe that; I did\\r\\nnot believe it could be on Sixth Avenue, but that is what Daly’s note\\r\\nsaid—come to that door, walk right in, and keep the appointment. It\\r\\nlooked very easy. It looked easy enough, but I had not much confidence\\r\\nin the Sixth Avenue door.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I was kind of bored on the train, and I bought some newspapers—New\\r\\nHaven newspapers—and there was not much news in them, so I read the\\r\\nadvertisements. There was one advertisement of a bench-show. I had\\r\\nheard of bench-shows, and I often wondered what there was about them\\r\\nto interest people. I had seen bench-shows—lectured to bench-shows, in\\r\\nfact—but I didn’t want to advertise them or to brag about them. Well, I\\r\\nread on a little, and learned that a bench-show was not a bench-show—but\\r\\ndogs, not benches at all—only dogs. I began to be interested, and as\\r\\nthere was nothing else to do I read every bit of the advertisement, and\\r\\nlearned that the biggest thing in this show was a St. Bernard dog that\\r\\nweighed one hundred and forty-five pounds. Before I got to New York I\\r\\nwas so interested in the bench-shows that I made up my mind to go to one\\r\\nthe first chance I got. Down on Sixth Avenue, near where that back door\\r\\nmight be, I began to take things leisurely. I did not like to be in too\\r\\nmuch of a hurry. There was not anything in sight that looked like a back\\r\\ndoor. The nearest approach to it was a cigar store. So I went in and\\r\\nbought a cigar, not too expensive, but it cost enough to pay for any\\r\\ninformation I might get and leave the dealer a fair profit. Well, I did\\r\\nnot like to be too abrupt, to make the man think me crazy, by asking him\\r\\nif that was the way to Daly’s Theatre, so I started gradually to lead up\\r\\nto the subject, asking him first if that was the way to Castle Garden.\\r\\nWhen I got to the real question, and he said he would show me the way, I\\r\\nwas astonished. He sent me through a long hallway, and I found myself\\r\\nin a back yard. Then I went through a long passageway and into a little\\r\\nroom, and there before my eyes was a big St. Bernard dog lying on a\\r\\nbench. There was another door beyond and I went there, and was met by a\\r\\nbig, fierce man with a fur cap on and coat off, who remarked, “Phwat do\\r\\nyez want?” I told him I wanted to see Mr. Daly. “Yez can’t see Mr. Daly\\r\\nthis time of night,” he responded. I urged that I had an appointment\\r\\nwith Mr. Daly, and gave him my card, which did not seem to impress\\r\\nhim much. “Yez can’t get in and yez can’t shmoke here. Throw away that\\r\\ncigar. If yez want to see Mr. Daly, yez ‘ll have to be after going to\\r\\nthe front door and buy a ticket, and then if yez have luck and he’s\\r\\naround that way yez may see him.” I was getting discouraged, but I had\\r\\none resource left that had been of good service in similar emergencies.\\r\\nFirmly but kindly I told him my name was Mark Twain, and I awaited\\r\\nresults. There was none. He was not fazed a bit. “Phwere’s your order\\r\\nto see Mr. Daly?” he asked. I handed him the note, and he examined it\\r\\nintently. “My friend,” I remarked, “you can read that better if you\\r\\nhold it the other side up.” But he took no notice of the suggestion, and\\r\\nfinally asked: “Where’s Mr. Daly’s name?” “There it is,” I told him,\\r\\n“on the top of the page.” “That’s all right,” he said, “that’s where\\r\\nhe always puts it; but I don’t see the ‘W’ in his name,” and he eyed\\r\\nme distrustfully. Finally, he asked, “Phwat do yez want to see Mr.\\r\\nDaly for?” “Business.” “Business?” “Yes.” It was my only hope. “Phwat\\r\\nkind—theatres?” that was too much. “No.” “What kind of shows, then?”\\r\\n “Bench-shows.” It was risky, but I was desperate. “Bench—shows, is\\r\\nit—where?” The big man’s face changed, and he began to look interested.\\r\\n“New Haven.” “New Haven, it is? Ah, that’s going to be a fine show. I’m\\r\\nglad to see you. Did you see a big dog in the other room?” “Yes.” “How\\r\\nmuch do you think that dog weighs?” “One hundred and forty-five pounds.”\\r\\n “Look at that, now! He’s a good judge of dogs, and no mistake. He weighs\\r\\nall of one hundred and thirty-eight. Sit down and shmoke—go on and\\r\\nshmoke your cigar, I’ll tell Mr. Daly you are here.” In a few minutes I\\r\\nwas on the stage shaking hands with Mr. Daly, and the big man standing\\r\\naround glowing with satisfaction. “Come around in front,” said Mr. Daly,\\r\\n“and see the performance. I will put you into my own box.” And as I\\r\\nmoved away I heard my honest friend mutter, “Well, he desarves it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DRESS OF CIVILIZED WOMAN\\r\\n\\r\\nA large part of the daughter of civilization is her dress—as it should\\r\\nbe. Some civilized women would lose half their charm without dress, and\\r\\nsome would lose all of it. The daughter of modern civilization dressed\\r\\nat her utmost best is a marvel of exquisite and beautiful art and\\r\\nexpense. All the lands, all the climes, and all the arts are laid under\\r\\ntribute to furnish her forth. Her linen is from Belfast, her robe is\\r\\nfrom Paris, her lace is from Venice, or Spain, or France, her feathers\\r\\nare from the remote regions of Southern Africa, her furs from the\\r\\nremoter region of the iceberg and the aurora, her fan from Japan, her\\r\\ndiamonds from Brazil, her bracelets from California, her pearls from\\r\\nCeylon, her cameos from Rome. She has gems and trinkets from buried\\r\\nPompeii, and others that graced comely Egyptian forms that have been\\r\\ndust and ashes now for forty centuries. Her watch is from Geneva, her\\r\\ncard case is from China, her hair is from—from—I don’t know where her\\r\\nhair is from; I never could find out; that is, her other hair—her public\\r\\nhair, her Sunday hair; I don’t mean the hair she goes to bed with.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that reminds me of a trifle. Any time you want to you can glance\\r\\naround the carpet of a Pullman car, and go and pick up a hair-pin; but\\r\\nnot to save your life can you get any woman in that car to acknowledge\\r\\nthat hair-pin. Now, isn’t that strange? But it’s true. The woman who\\r\\nhas never swerved from cast-iron veracity and fidelity in her whole life\\r\\nwill, when confronted with this crucial test, deny her hair-pin. She\\r\\nwill deny that hair-pin before a hundred witnesses. I have stupidly got\\r\\ninto more trouble and more hot water trying to hunt up the owner of a\\r\\nhair-pin in a Pullman than by any other indiscretion of my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDRESS REFORM AND COPYRIGHT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          When the present copyright law was under discussion, Mr.\\r\\n          Clemens appeared before the committee.  He had sent Speaker\\r\\n          Cannon the following letter:\\r\\n\\r\\n          “DEAR UNCLE JOSEPH,--Please get me the thanks of Congress, not\\r\\n          next week but right away.  It is very necessary.  Do accomplish\\r\\n          this for your affectionate old friend right away--by\\r\\n          persuasion if you can, by violence if you must, for it is\\r\\n          imperatively necessary that I get on the floor of the House for\\r\\n          two or three hours and talk to the members, man by man, in\\r\\n          behalf of support, encouragement, and protection of one of the\\r\\n          nation’s most valuable assets and industries--its literature.\\r\\n          I have arguments with me--also a barrel with liquid in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n          “Give me a chance.  Get me the thanks of Congress.  Don’t wait\\r\\n          for others--there isn’t time; furnish them to me yourself and\\r\\n          let Congress ratify later.  I have stayed away and let Congress\\r\\n          alone for seventy-one years and am entitled to the thanks.\\r\\n          Congress knows this perfectly well, and I have long felt hurt\\r\\n          that this quite proper and earned expression of gratitude has\\r\\n          been merely felt by the House and never publicly uttered.\\r\\n\\r\\n          “Send me an order on the sergeant-at-arms quick.  When shall I\\r\\n          come?\\r\\n                                   “With love and a benediction,\\r\\n                                                       “MARK TWAIN.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          While waiting to appear before the committee, Mr. Clemens\\r\\n          talked to the reporters:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy don’t you ask why I am wearing such apparently unseasonable clothes?\\r\\nI’ll tell you. I have found that when a man reaches the advanced age of\\r\\nseventy-one years, as I have, the continual sight of dark clothing is\\r\\nlikely to have a depressing effect upon him. Light-colored clothing\\r\\nis more pleasing to the eye and enlivens the spirit. Now, of course,\\r\\nI cannot compel every one to wear such clothing just for my especial\\r\\nbenefit, so I do the next best thing and wear it myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, before a man reaches my years the fear of criticism might\\r\\nprevent him from indulging his fancy. I am not afraid of that. I am\\r\\ndecidedly for pleasing color combinations in dress. I like to see the\\r\\nwomen’s clothes, say, at the opera. What can be more depressing than the\\r\\nsombre black which custom requires men to wear upon state occasions? A\\r\\ngroup of men in evening clothes looks like a flock of crows, and is just\\r\\nabout as inspiring.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, what is the purpose of clothing? Are not clothes intended\\r\\nprimarily to preserve dignity and also to afford comfort to their\\r\\nwearer? Now I know of nothing more uncomfortable than the present-day\\r\\nclothes of men. The finest clothing made is a person’s own skin, but, of\\r\\ncourse, society demands something more than this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best-dressed man I have ever seen, however, was a native of the\\r\\nSandwich Islands who attracted my attention thirty years ago. Now, when\\r\\nthat man wanted to don especial dress to honor a public occasion or a\\r\\nholiday, why, he occasionally put on a pair of spectacles. Otherwise the\\r\\nclothing with which God had provided him sufficed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, I have ideas of dress reform. For one thing, why not adopt\\r\\nsome of the women’s styles? Goodness knows, they adopt enough of ours.\\r\\nTake the peek-a-boo waist, for instance. It has the obvious advantages\\r\\nof being cool and comfortable, and in addition it is almost always made\\r\\nup in pleasing colors which cheer and do not depress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that I dressed the Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur’s Court\\r\\nin a plug-hat, but, let’s see, that was twenty-five years ago. Then no\\r\\nman was considered fully dressed until he donned a plug-hat. Nowadays I\\r\\nthink that no man is dressed until he leaves it home. Why, when I left\\r\\nhome yesterday they trotted out a plug-hat for me to wear.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must wear it,” they told me; “why, just think of going to\\r\\nWashington without a plug-hat!” But I said no; I would wear a derby or\\r\\nnothing. Why, I believe I could walk along the streets of New York—I\\r\\nnever do—but still I think I could—and I should never see a well-dressed\\r\\nman wearing a plug-hat. If I did I should suspect him of something. I\\r\\ndon’t know just what, but I would suspect him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, when I got up on the second story of that Pennsylvania ferry-boat\\r\\ncoming down here yesterday I saw Howells coming along. He was the only\\r\\nman on the boat with a plug-hat, and I tell you he felt ashamed of\\r\\nhimself. He said he had been persuaded to wear it against his better\\r\\nsense. But just think of a man nearly seventy years old who has not a\\r\\nmind of his own on such matters!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you doing any work now?” the youngest and most serious reporter\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork? I retired from work on my seventieth birthday. Since then I\\r\\nhave been putting in merely twenty-six hours a day dictating my\\r\\nautobiography, which, as John Phoenix said in regard to his autograph,\\r\\nmay be relied upon as authentic, as it is written exclusively by me.\\r\\nBut it is not to be published in full until I am thoroughly dead. I have\\r\\nmade it as caustic, fiendish, and devilish as possible. It will fill\\r\\nmany volumes, and I shall continue writing it until the time comes for\\r\\nme to join the angels. It is going to be a terrible autobiography. It\\r\\nwill make the hair of some folks curl. But it cannot be published\\r\\nuntil I am dead, and the persons mentioned in it and their children and\\r\\ngrandchildren are dead. It is something awful!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you tell us the names of some of the notables that are here to see\\r\\nyou off?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t know. I am so shy. My shyness takes a peculiar phase. I never\\r\\nlook a person in the face. The reason is that I am afraid they may know\\r\\nme and that I may not know them, which makes it very embarrassing for\\r\\nboth of us. I always wait for the other person to speak. I know lots of\\r\\npeople, but I don’t know who they are. It is all a matter of ability to\\r\\nobserve things. I never observe anything now. I gave up the habit years\\r\\nago. You should keep a habit up if you want to become proficient in it.\\r\\nFor instance, I was a pilot once, but I gave it up, and I do not believe\\r\\nthe captain of the Minneapolis would let me navigate his ship to London.\\r\\nStill, if I think that he is not on the job I may go up on the bridge\\r\\nand offer him a few suggestions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOLLEGE GIRLS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Five hundred undergraduates, under the auspices of the Woman’s\\r\\n          University Club, New York, welcomed Mr. Clemens as their guest,\\r\\n          April 3, 1906, and gave him the freedom of the club, which the\\r\\n          chairman explained was freedom to talk individually to any girl\\r\\n          present.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve worked for the public good thirty years, so for the rest of my life\\r\\nI shall work for my personal contentment. I am glad Miss Neron has fed\\r\\nme, for there is no telling what iniquity I might wander into on an\\r\\nempty stomach—I mean, an empty mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am going to tell you a practical story about how once upon a time I\\r\\nwas blind—a story I should have been using all these months, but I never\\r\\nthought about telling it until the other night, and now it is too late,\\r\\nfor on the nineteenth of this month I hope to take formal leave of the\\r\\nplatform forever at Carnegie Hall—that is, take leave so far as talking\\r\\nfor money and for people who have paid money to hear me talk. I shall\\r\\ncontinue to infest the platform on these conditions—that there is nobody\\r\\nin the house who has paid to hear me, that I am not paid to be heard,\\r\\nand that there will be none but young women students in the audience.\\r\\n[Here Mr. Clemens told the story of how he took a girl to the theatre\\r\\nwhile he was wearing tight boots, which appears elsewhere in this\\r\\nvolume, and ended by saying: “And now let this be a lesson to you—I\\r\\ndon’t know what kind of a lesson; I’ll let you think it out.”]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGIRLS\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my capacity of publisher I recently received a manuscript from\\r\\na teacher which embodied a number of answers given by her pupils to\\r\\nquestions propounded. These answers show that the children had nothing\\r\\nbut the sound to go by—the sense was perfectly empty. Here are some of\\r\\ntheir answers to words they were asked to define: Auriferous—pertaining\\r\\nto an orifice; ammonia—the food of the gods; equestrian—one who asks\\r\\nquestions; parasite—a kind of umbrella; ipecaca—man who likes a good\\r\\ndinner. And here is the definition of an ancient word honored by a\\r\\ngreat party: Republican—a sinner mentioned in the Bible. And here is\\r\\nan innocent deliverance of a zoological kind: “There are a good many\\r\\ndonkeys in the theological gardens.” Here also is a definition which\\r\\nreally isn’t very bad in its way: Demagogue—a vessel containing beer and\\r\\nother liquids. Here, too, is a sample of a boy’s composition on girls,\\r\\nwhich, I must say, I rather like:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Girls are very stuckup and dignified in their manner and behaveyour.\\r\\nThey think more of dress than anything and like to play with dowls and\\r\\nrags. They cry if they see a cow in a far distance and are afraid of\\r\\nguns. They stay at home all the time and go to church every Sunday. They\\r\\nare al-ways sick. They are al-ways furry and making fun of boys hands\\r\\nand they say how dirty. They cant play marbles. I pity them poor things.\\r\\nThey make fun of boys and then turn round and love them. I don’t belave\\r\\nthey ever kiled a cat or anything. They look out every nite and say,\\r\\n‘Oh, a’nt the moon lovely!’—Thir is one thing I have not told and that\\r\\nis they al-ways now their lessons bettern boys.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LADIES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          DELIVERED AT THE ANNIVERSARY FESTIVAL, 1872, OF THE SCOTTISH\\r\\n          CORPORATION OF LONDON\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens replied to the toast “The Ladies.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI am proud, indeed, of the distinction of being chosen to respond to\\r\\nthis especial toast, to “The Ladies,” or to women if you please, for\\r\\nthat is the preferable term, perhaps; it is certainly the older, and\\r\\ntherefore the more entitled to reverence. I have noticed that the\\r\\nBible, with that plain, blunt honesty which is such a conspicuous\\r\\ncharacteristic of the Scriptures, is always particular to never refer\\r\\nto even the illustrious mother of all mankind as a “lady,” but speaks of\\r\\nher as a woman. It is odd, but you will find it is so. I am peculiarly\\r\\nproud of this honor, because I think that the toast to women is one\\r\\nwhich, by right and by every rule of gallantry, should take precedence\\r\\nof all others—of the army, of the navy, of even royalty itself—perhaps,\\r\\nthough the latter is not necessary in this day and in this land, for the\\r\\nreason that, tacitly, you do drink a broad general health to all good\\r\\nwomen when you drink the health of the Queen of England and the Princess\\r\\nof Wales. I have in mind a poem just now which is familiar to you\\r\\nall, familiar to everybody. And what an inspiration that was, and how\\r\\ninstantly the present toast recalls the verses to all our minds when\\r\\nthe most noble, the most gracious, the purest, and sweetest of all poets\\r\\nsays:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                         “Woman!  O woman!---er\\r\\n                         Wom----”\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, you remember the lines; and you remember how feelingly, how\\r\\ndaintily, how almost imperceptibly the verses raise up before you,\\r\\nfeature by feature, the ideal of a true and perfect woman; and how, as\\r\\nyou contemplate the finished marvel, your homage grows into worship of\\r\\nthe intellect that could create so fair a thing out of mere breath, mere\\r\\nwords. And you call to mind now, as I speak, how the poet, with stern\\r\\nfidelity to the history of all humanity, delivers this beautiful child\\r\\nof his heart and his brain over to the trials and sorrows that must come\\r\\nto all, sooner or later, that abide in the earth, and how the pathetic\\r\\nstory culminates in that apostrophe—so wild, so regretful, so full of\\r\\nmournful retrospection. The lines run thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                        “Alas!--alas!--a--alas!\\r\\n                         ----Alas!--------alas!”\\r\\n\\r\\n—and so on. I do not remember the rest; but, taken together, it seems to\\r\\nme that poem is the noblest tribute to woman that human genius has ever\\r\\nbrought forth—and I feel that if I were to talk hours I could not do my\\r\\ngreat theme completer or more graceful justice than I have now done in\\r\\nsimply quoting that poet’s matchless words. The phases of the womanly\\r\\nnature are infinite in their variety. Take any type of woman, and you\\r\\nshall find in it something to respect, something to admire, something to\\r\\nlove. And you shall find the whole joining you heart and hand. Who was\\r\\nmore patriotic than Joan of Arc? Who was braver? Who has given us a\\r\\ngrander instance of self-sacrificing devotion? Ah! you remember, you\\r\\nremember well, what a throb of pain, what a great tidal wave of grief\\r\\nswept over us all when Joan of Arc fell at Waterloo. Who does not sorrow\\r\\nfor the loss of Sappho, the sweet singer of Israel? Who among us does\\r\\nnot miss the gentle ministrations, the softening influences, the humble\\r\\npiety of Lucretia Borgia? Who can join in the heartless libel that says\\r\\nwoman is extravagant in dress when he can look back and call to mind our\\r\\nsimple and lowly mother Eve arrayed in her modification of the Highland\\r\\ncostume? Sir, women have been soldiers, women have been painters, women\\r\\nhave been poets. As long as language lives the name of Cleopatra will\\r\\nlive. And not because she conquered George III.—but because she wrote\\r\\nthose divine lines:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                   “Let dogs delight to bark and bite,\\r\\n                    For God hath made them so.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the world is adorned with the names of illustrious ones of\\r\\nour own sex—some of them sons of St. Andrew, too—Scott, Bruce, Burns,\\r\\nthe warrior Wallace, Ben Nevis—the gifted Ben Lomond, and the great\\r\\nnew Scotchman, Ben Disraeli.—[Mr. Benjamin Disraeli, at that time\\r\\nPrime Minister of England, had just been elected Lord Rector of\\r\\nGlasgow University, and had made a speech which gave rise to a world\\r\\nof discussion]—Out of the great plains of history tower whole mountain\\r\\nranges of sublime women: the Queen of Sheba, Josephine, Semiramis,\\r\\nSairey Gamp; the list is endless—but I will not call the mighty roll,\\r\\nthe names rise up in your own memories at the mere suggestion, luminous\\r\\nwith the glory of deeds that cannot die, hallowed by the loving worship\\r\\nof the good and the true of all epochs and all climes. Suffice it for\\r\\nour pride and our honor that we in our day have added to it such names\\r\\nas those of Grace Darling and Florence Nightingale. Woman is all that\\r\\nshe should be—gentle, patient, longsuffering, trustful, unselfish,\\r\\nfull of generous impulses. It is her blessed mission to comfort the\\r\\nsorrowing, plead for the erring, encourage the faint of purpose, succor\\r\\nthe distressed, uplift the fallen, befriend the friendless—in a word,\\r\\nafford the healing of her sympathies and a home in her heart for all the\\r\\nbruised and persecuted children that knock at its hospitable door. And\\r\\nwhen I say, God bless her, there is none among us who has known the\\r\\nennobling affection of a wife, or the steadfast devotion of a mother but\\r\\nin his heart will say, Amen!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWOMAN’S PRESS CLUB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          On October 27, 1900, the New York Woman’s Press Club gave a tea\\r\\n          in Carnegie Hall.  Mr. Clemens was the guest of honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I were asked an opinion I would call this an ungrammatical nation.\\r\\nThere is no such thing as perfect grammar, and I don’t always speak good\\r\\ngrammar myself. But I have been foregathering for the past few days with\\r\\nprofessors of American universities, and I’ve heard them all say things\\r\\nlike this: “He don’t like to do it.” [There was a stir.] Oh, you’ll hear\\r\\nthat to-night if you listen, or, “He would have liked to have done it.”\\r\\n You’ll catch some educated Americans saying that. When these men take\\r\\npen in hand they write with as good grammar as any. But the moment they\\r\\nthrow the pen aside they throw grammatical morals aside with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo illustrate the desirability and possibility of concentration, I must\\r\\ntell you a story of my little six-year-old daughter. The governess\\r\\nhad been teaching her about the reindeer, and, as the custom was, she\\r\\nrelated it to the family. She reduced the history of that reindeer to\\r\\ntwo or three sentences when the governess could not have put it into a\\r\\npage. She said: “The reindeer is a very swift animal. A reindeer once\\r\\ndrew a sled four hundred miles in two hours.” She appended the comment:\\r\\n“This was regarded as extraordinary.” And concluded: “When that reindeer\\r\\nwas done drawing that sled four hundred miles in two hours it died.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a final instance of the force of limitations in the development of\\r\\nconcentration, I must mention that beautiful creature, Helen Keller,\\r\\nwhom I have known for these many years. I am filled with the wonder\\r\\nof her knowledge, acquired because shut out from all distraction. If\\r\\nI could have been deaf, dumb, and blind I also might have arrived at\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVOTES FOR WOMEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE HEBREW TECHNICAL SCHOOL FOR GIRLS,\\r\\n          HELD IN THE TEMPLE EMMANUEL, JANUARY 20, 1901\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens was introduced by President Meyer, who said: “In\\r\\n          one of Mr. Clemens’s works he expressed his opinion of men,\\r\\n          saying he had no choice between Hebrew and Gentile, black men\\r\\n          or white; to him all men were alike.  But I never could find\\r\\n          that he expressed his opinion of women; perhaps that opinion\\r\\n          was so exalted that he could not express it.  We shall now be\\r\\n          called to hear what he thinks of women.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN,—It is a small help that I can afford, but it is\\r\\njust such help that one can give as coming from the heart through the\\r\\nmouth. The report of Mr. Meyer was admirable, and I was as interested in\\r\\nit as you have been. Why, I’m twice as old as he, and I’ve had so much\\r\\nexperience that I would say to him, when he makes his appeal for help:\\r\\n“Don’t make it for to-day or to-morrow, but collect the money on the\\r\\nspot.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are all creatures of sudden impulse. We must be worked up by steam,\\r\\nas it were. Get them to write their wills now, or it may be too late\\r\\nby-and-by. Fifteen or twenty years ago I had an experience I shall\\r\\nnever forget. I got into a church which was crowded by a sweltering\\r\\nand panting multitude. The city missionary of our town—Hartford—made a\\r\\ntelling appeal for help. He told of personal experiences among the poor\\r\\nin cellars and top lofts requiring instances of devotion and help. The\\r\\npoor are always good to the poor. When a person with his millions gives\\r\\na hundred thousand dollars it makes a great noise in the world, but he\\r\\ndoes not miss it; it’s the widow’s mite that makes no noise but does the\\r\\nbest work.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember on that occasion in the Hartford church the collection was\\r\\nbeing taken up. The appeal had so stirred me that I could hardly wait\\r\\nfor the hat or plate to come my way. I had four hundred dollars in my\\r\\npocket, and I was anxious to drop it in the plate and wanted to borrow\\r\\nmore. But the plate was so long in coming my way that the fever-heat of\\r\\nbeneficence was going down lower and lower—going down at the rate of a\\r\\nhundred dollars a minute. The plate was passed too late. When it finally\\r\\ncame to me, my enthusiasm had gone down so much that I kept my four\\r\\nhundred dollars—and stole a dime from the plate. So, you see, time\\r\\nsometimes leads to crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, many a time have I thought of that and regretted it, and I adjure\\r\\nyou all to give while the fever is on you.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferring to woman’s sphere in life, I’ll say that woman is always\\r\\nright. For twenty-five years I’ve been a woman’s rights man. I have\\r\\nalways believed, long before my mother died, that, with her gray hairs\\r\\nand admirable intellect, perhaps she knew as much as I did. Perhaps she\\r\\nknew as much about voting as I.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should like to see the time come when women shall help to make the\\r\\nlaws. I should like to see that whip-lash, the ballot, in the hands of\\r\\nwomen. As for this city’s government, I don’t want to say much, except\\r\\nthat it is a shame—a shame; but if I should live twenty-five years\\r\\nlonger—and there is no reason why I shouldn’t—I think I’ll see women\\r\\nhandle the ballot. If women had the ballot to-day, the state of things\\r\\nin this town would not exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf all the women in this town had a vote to-day they would elect a mayor\\r\\nat the next election, and they would rise in their might and change the\\r\\nawful state of things now existing here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWOMAN-AN OPINION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT AN EARLY BANQUET OF THE WASHINGTON\\r\\n          CORRESPONDENTS’ CLUB\\r\\n\\r\\n          The twelfth toast was as follows: “Woman--The pride of any\\r\\n          profession, and the jewel of ours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PRESIDENT,—I do not know why I should be singled out to receive the\\r\\ngreatest distinction of the evening—for so the office of replying to the\\r\\ntoast of woman has been regarded in every age. I do not know why I have\\r\\nreceived this distinction, unless it be that I am a trifle less\\r\\nhomely than the other members of the club. But be this as it may, Mr.\\r\\nPresident, I am proud of the position, and you could not have chosen any\\r\\none who would have accepted it more gladly, or labored with a heartier\\r\\ngood-will to do the subject justice than I—because, sir, I love the sex.\\r\\nI love all the women, irrespective of age or color.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman intellect cannot estimate what we owe to woman, sir. She sews on\\r\\nour buttons; she mends our clothes; she ropes us in at the church fairs;\\r\\nshe confides in us; she tells us whatever she can find out about the\\r\\nlittle private affairs of the neighbors; she gives us good advice, and\\r\\nplenty of it; she soothes our aching brows; she bears our children—ours\\r\\nas a general thing. In all relations of life, sir, it is but a just and\\r\\ngraceful tribute to woman to say of her that she is a brick.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheresoever you place woman, sir—in whatever position or estate—she\\r\\nis an ornament to the place she occupies, and a treasure to the world.\\r\\n[Here Mr. Clemens paused, looked inquiringly at his hearers, and\\r\\nremarked that the applause should come in at this point. It came in.\\r\\nHe resumed his eulogy.] Look at Cleopatra! look at Desdemona!—look at\\r\\nFlorence Nightingale!—look at Joan of Arc!—look at Lucretia Borgia!\\r\\n[Disapprobation expressed.] Well [said Mr. Clemens, scratching his head,\\r\\ndoubtfully], suppose we let Lucretia slide. Look at Joyce Heth!—look at\\r\\nMother Eve! You need not look at her unless you want to, but [said\\r\\nMr. Clemens, reflectively, after a pause] Eve was ornamental,\\r\\nsir—particularly before the fashions changed. I repeat, sir, look at the\\r\\nillustrious names of history. Look at the Widow Machree!—look at Lucy\\r\\nStone!—look at Elizabeth Cady Stanton!—look at George Francis Train!\\r\\nAnd, sir, I say it with bowed head and deepest veneration—look at the\\r\\nmother of Washington! She raised a boy that could not tell a lie—could\\r\\nnot tell a lie! But he never had any chance. It might have been\\r\\ndifferent if he had belonged to the Washington Newspaper Correspondents’\\r\\nClub.\\r\\n\\r\\nI repeat, sir, that in whatever position you place a woman she is an\\r\\nornament to society and a treasure to the world. As a sweetheart, she\\r\\nhas few equals and no superiors; as a cousin, she is convenient; as a\\r\\nwealthy grandmother with an incurable distemper, she is precious; as a\\r\\nwetnurse, she has no equal among men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat, sir, would the people of the earth be without woman? They would\\r\\nbe scarce, sir, almighty scarce. Then let us cherish her; let us protect\\r\\nher; let us give her our support, our encouragement, our sympathy,\\r\\nourselves—if we get a chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, jesting aside, Mr. President, woman is lovable, gracious, kind of\\r\\nheart, beautiful—worthy of all respect, of all esteem, of all deference.\\r\\nNot any here will refuse to drink her health right cordially in this\\r\\nbumper of wine, for each and every one has personally known, and loved,\\r\\nand honored the very best one of them all—his own mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nADVICE TO GIRLS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          In 1907 a young girl whom Mr. Clemens met on the steamer\\r\\n          Minnehaha called him “grandpa,” and he called her his\\r\\n          granddaughter.  She was attending St. Timothy’s School, at\\r\\n          Catonsville, Maryland, and Mr. Clemens promised her to see her\\r\\n          graduate.  He accordingly made the journey from New York on\\r\\n          June 10, 1909, and delivered a short address.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t know what to tell you girls to do. Mr. Martin has told you\\r\\neverything you ought to do, and now I must give you some don’ts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three things which come to my mind which I consider excellent\\r\\nadvice:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, girls, don’t smoke—that is, don’t smoke to excess. I am\\r\\nseventy-three and a half years old, and have been smoking seventy-three\\r\\nof them. But I never smoke to excess—that is, I smoke in moderation,\\r\\nonly one cigar at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, don’t drink—that is, don’t drink to excess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, don’t marry—I mean, to excess.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonesty is the best policy. That is an old proverb; but you don’t want\\r\\never to forget it in your journey through life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTAXES AND MORALS\\r\\n\\r\\nADDRESS DELIVERED IN NEW YORK, JANUARY 22, 1906\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          At the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of Tuskeegee\\r\\n          Institute by Booker Washington, Mr. Choate presided, and in\\r\\n          introducing Mr. Clemens made fun of him because he made play\\r\\n          his work, and that when he worked hardest he did so lying in\\r\\n          bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI came here in the responsible capacity of policeman to watch Mr.\\r\\nChoate. This is an occasion of grave and serious importance, and it\\r\\nseems necessary for me to be present, so that if he tried to work\\r\\noff any statement that required correction, reduction, refutation, or\\r\\nexposure, there would be a tried friend of the public to protect the\\r\\nhouse. He has not made one statement whose veracity fails to tally\\r\\nexactly with my own standard. I have never seen a person improve so.\\r\\nThis makes me thankful and proud of a country that can produce such\\r\\nmen—two such men. And all in the same country. We can’t be with you\\r\\nalways; we are passing away, and then—well, everything will have to\\r\\nstop, I reckon. It is a sad thought. But in spirit I shall still be with\\r\\nyou. Choate, too—if he can.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery born American among the eighty millions, let his creed or\\r\\ndestitution of creed be what it may, is indisputably a Christian—to this\\r\\ndegree that his moral constitution is Christian.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two kinds of Christian morals, one private and the other\\r\\npublic. These two are so distinct, so unrelated, that they are no more\\r\\nakin to each other than are archangels and politicians. During three\\r\\nhundred and sixty-three days in the year the American citizen is true to\\r\\nhis Christian private morals, and keeps undefiled the nation’s character\\r\\nat its best and highest; then in the other two days of the year he\\r\\nleaves his Christian private morals at home and carries his Christian\\r\\npublic morals to the tax office and the polls, and does the best he can\\r\\nto damage and undo his whole year’s faithful and righteous work. Without\\r\\na blush he will vote for an unclean boss if that boss is his party’s\\r\\nMoses, without compunction he will vote against the best man in the\\r\\nwhole land if he is on the other ticket. Every year in a number of\\r\\ncities and States he helps put corrupt men in office, whereas if\\r\\nhe would but throw away his Christian public morals, and carry his\\r\\nChristian private morals to the polls, he could promptly purify the\\r\\npublic service and make the possession of office a high and honorable\\r\\ndistinction.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a year he lays aside his Christian private morals and hires a\\r\\nferry-boat and piles up his bonds in a warehouse in New Jersey for\\r\\nthree days, and gets out his Christian public morals and goes to the tax\\r\\noffice and holds up his hands and swears he wishes he may never—never if\\r\\nhe’s got a cent in the world, so help him. The next day the list appears\\r\\nin the papers—a column and a quarter of names, in fine print, and every\\r\\nman in the list a billionaire and member of a couple of churches. I know\\r\\nall those people. I have friendly, social, and criminal relations with\\r\\nthe whole lot of them. They never miss a sermon when they are so’s to be\\r\\naround, and they never miss swearing-off day, whether they are so’s to\\r\\nbe around or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nI used to be an honest man. I am crumbling. No—I have crumbled. When\\r\\nthey assessed me at $75,000 a fortnight ago I went out and tried to\\r\\nborrow the money, and couldn’t; then when I found they were letting a\\r\\nwhole crop of millionaires live in New York at a third of the price they\\r\\nwere charging me I was hurt, I was indignant, and said: “This is the\\r\\nlast feather. I am not going to run this town all by myself.” In that\\r\\nmoment—in that memorable moment—I began to crumble. In fifteen minutes\\r\\nthe disintegration was complete. In fifteen minutes I had become just a\\r\\nmere moral sand-pile; and I lifted up my hand along with those seasoned\\r\\nand experienced deacons and swore off every rag of personal property\\r\\nI’ve got in the world, clear down to cork leg, glass eye, and what is\\r\\nleft of my wig.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose tax officers were moved; they were profoundly moved. They had long\\r\\nbeen accustomed to seeing hardened old grafters act like that, and they\\r\\ncould endure the spectacle; but they were expecting better things of me,\\r\\na chartered, professional moralist, and they were saddened.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fell visibly in their respect and esteem, and I should have fallen in\\r\\nmy own, except that I had already struck bottom, and there wasn’t any\\r\\nplace to fall to.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Tuskeegee they will jump to misleading conclusions from insufficient\\r\\nevidence, along with Doctor Parkhurst, and they will deceive the student\\r\\nwith the superstition that no gentleman ever swears.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook at those good millionaires; aren’t they gentlemen? Well, they\\r\\nswear. Only once in a year, maybe, but there’s enough bulk to it to make\\r\\nup for the lost time. And do they lose anything by it? No, they don’t;\\r\\nthey save enough in three minutes to support the family seven years.\\r\\nWhen they swear, do we shudder? No—unless they say “damn!” Then we do.\\r\\nIt shrivels us all up. Yet we ought not to feel so about it, because we\\r\\nall swear—everybody. Including the ladies. Including Doctor Parkhurst,\\r\\nthat strong and brave and excellent citizen, but superficially educated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor it is not the word that is the sin, it is the spirit back of the\\r\\nword. When an irritated lady says “oh!” the spirit back of it is “damn!”\\r\\n and that is the way it is going to be recorded against her. It always\\r\\nmakes me so sorry when I hear a lady swear like that. But if she says\\r\\n“damn,” and says it in an amiable, nice way, it isn’t going to be\\r\\nrecorded at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that no gentleman ever swears is all wrong; he can swear\\r\\nand still be a gentleman if he does it in a nice and, benevolent and\\r\\naffectionate way. The historian, John Fiske, whom I knew well and loved,\\r\\nwas a spotless and most noble and upright Christian gentleman, and yet\\r\\nhe swore once. Not exactly that, maybe; still, he—but I will tell you\\r\\nabout it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, when he was deeply immersed in his work, his wife came in, much\\r\\nmoved and profoundly distressed, and said: “I am sorry to disturb you,\\r\\nJohn, but I must, for this is a serious matter, and needs to be attended\\r\\nto at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, lamenting, she brought a grave accusation against their little\\r\\nson. She said: “He has been saying his Aunt Mary is a fool and his Aunt\\r\\nMartha is a damned fool.” Mr. Fiske reflected upon the matter a minute,\\r\\nthen said: “Oh, well, it’s about the distinction I should make between\\r\\nthem myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Washington, I beg you to convey these teachings to your great and\\r\\nprosperous and most beneficent educational institution, and add them to\\r\\nthe prodigal mental and moral riches wherewith you equip your fortunate\\r\\nproteges for the struggle of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTAMMANY AND CROKER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens made his debut as a campaign orator on October 7,\\r\\n          1901, advocating the election of Seth Low for Mayor, not as a\\r\\n          Republican, but as a member of the “Acorns,” which he described\\r\\n          as a “third party having no political affiliation, but was\\r\\n          concerned only in the selection of the best candidates and the\\r\\n          best member.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat Britain had a Tammany and a Croker a good while ago. This Tammany\\r\\nwas in India, and it began its career with the spread of the English\\r\\ndominion after the Battle of Plassey. Its first boss was Clive, a\\r\\nsufficiently crooked person sometimes, but straight as a yard stick\\r\\nwhen compared with the corkscrew crookedness of the second boss, Warren\\r\\nHastings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat old-time Tammany was the East India Company’s government, and had\\r\\nits headquarters at Calcutta. Ostensibly it consisted of a Great Council\\r\\nof four persons, of whom one was the Governor-General, Warren Hastings;\\r\\nreally it consisted of one person—Warren Hastings; for by usurpation he\\r\\nconcentrated all authority in himself and governed the country like an\\r\\nautocrat.\\r\\n\\r\\nOstensibly the Court of Directors, sitting in London and representing\\r\\nthe vast interests of the stockholders, was supreme in authority over\\r\\nthe Calcutta Great Council, whose membership it appointed and removed at\\r\\npleasure, whose policies it dictated, and to whom it conveyed its will\\r\\nin the form of sovereign commands; but whenever it suited Hastings,\\r\\nhe ignored even that august body’s authority and conducted the mighty\\r\\naffairs of the British Empire in India to suit his own notions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt his mercy was the daily bread of every official, every trader, every\\r\\nclerk, every civil servant, big and little, in the whole huge India\\r\\nCompany’s machine, and the man who hazarded his bread by any failure of\\r\\nsubserviency to the boss lost it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow then, let the supreme masters of British India, the giant\\r\\ncorporation of the India Company of London, stand for the voters of the\\r\\ncity of New York; let the Great Council of Calcutta stand for Tammany;\\r\\nlet the corrupt and money-grubbing great hive of serfs which served\\r\\nunder the Indian Tammany’s rod stand for New York Tammany’s serfs; let\\r\\nWarren Hastings stand for Richard Croker, and it seems to me that the\\r\\nparallel is exact and complete. And so let us be properly grateful and\\r\\nthank God and our good luck that we didn’t invent Tammany.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund Burke, regarded by many as the greatest orator of all times,\\r\\nconducted the case against Warren Hastings in that renowned trial which\\r\\nlasted years, and which promises to keep its renown for centuries to\\r\\ncome. I wish to quote some of the things he said. I wish to imagine him\\r\\narraigning Mr. Croker and Tammany before the voters of New York City and\\r\\npleading with them for the overthrow of that combined iniquity of\\r\\nthe 5th of November, and will substitute for “My Lords,” read\\r\\n“Fellow-Citizens”; for “Kingdom,” read “City”; for “Parliamentary\\r\\nProcess,” read “Political Campaign”; for “Two Houses,” read “Two\\r\\nParties,” and so it reads:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fellow—citizens, I must look upon it as an auspicious circumstance to\\r\\nthis cause, in which the honor of the city is involved, that from the\\r\\nfirst commencement of our political campaign to this the hour of solemn\\r\\ntrial not the smallest difference of opinion has arisen, between the two\\r\\nparties.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will see, in the progress of this cause, that there is not only\\r\\na long, connected, systematic series of misdemeanors, but an equally\\r\\nconnected system of maxims and principles invented to justify them. Upon\\r\\nboth of these you must judge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not only the interest of the city of New York, now the most\\r\\nconsiderable part of the city of the Americans, which is concerned,\\r\\nbut the credit and honor of the nation itself will be decided by this\\r\\ndecision.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          At a later meeting of the Acorn Club, Mr. Clemens said:\\r\\n\\r\\nTammany is dead, and there’s no use in blackguarding a corpse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe election makes me think of a story of a man who was dying. He had\\r\\nonly two minutes to live, so he sent for a clergyman and asked him,\\r\\n“Where is the best place to go to?” He was undecided about it. So the\\r\\nminister told him that each place had its advantages—heaven for climate,\\r\\nand hell for society.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMUNICIPAL CORRUPTION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE CITY CLUB DINNER, JANUARY 4,1901\\r\\n\\r\\n          Bishop Potter told how an alleged representative of Tammany\\r\\n          Hall asked him in effect if he would cease his warfare upon the\\r\\n          Police Department if a certain captain and inspector were\\r\\n          dismissed.  He replied that he would never be satisfied until\\r\\n          the “man at the top” and the “system” which permitted evils in\\r\\n          the Police Department were crushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bishop has just spoken of a condition of things which none of us\\r\\ncan deny, and which ought not to exist; that is, the lust of gain—a lust\\r\\nwhich does not stop short of the penitentiary or the jail to accomplish\\r\\nits ends. But we may be sure of one thing, and that is that this sort of\\r\\nthing is not universal. If it were, this country would not be. You may\\r\\nput this down as a fact: that out of every fifty men, forty-nine are\\r\\nclean. Then why is it, you may ask, that the forty-nine don’t have\\r\\nthings the way they want them? I’ll tell you why it is. A good deal\\r\\nhas been said here to-night about what is to be accomplished by\\r\\norganization. That’s just the thing. It’s because the fiftieth fellow\\r\\nand his pals are organized and the other forty-nine are not that the\\r\\ndirty one rubs it into the clean fellows every time.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may say organize, organize, organize; but there may be so much\\r\\norganization that it will interfere with the work to be done. The Bishop\\r\\nhere had an experience of that sort, and told all about it down-town the\\r\\nother night. He was painting a barn—it was his own barn—and yet he\\r\\nwas informed that his work must stop; he was a non-union painter, and\\r\\ncouldn’t continue at that sort of job.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, all these conditions of which you complain should be remedied, and\\r\\nI am here to tell you just how to do it. I’ve been a statesman without\\r\\nsalary for many years, and I have accomplished great and widespread\\r\\ngood. I don’t know that it has benefited anybody very much, even if\\r\\nit was good; but I do know that it hasn’t harmed me very much, and is\\r\\nhasn’t made me any richer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hold the balance of power. Put up your best men for office, and we\\r\\nshall support the better one. With the election of the best man for\\r\\nMayor would follow the selection of the best man for Police Commissioner\\r\\nand Chief of Police.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first lesson in the craft of statesmanship was taken at an early age.\\r\\nFifty-one years ago I was fourteen years old, and we had a society in\\r\\nthe town I lived in, patterned after the Freemasons, or the Ancient\\r\\nOrder of United Farmers, or some such thing—just what it was patterned\\r\\nafter doesn’t matter. It had an inside guard and an outside guard, and\\r\\na past-grand warden, and a lot of such things, so as to give dignity to\\r\\nthe organization and offices to the members.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally speaking it was a pretty good sort of organization, and\\r\\nsome of the very best boys in the village, including—but I mustn’t get\\r\\npersonal on an occasion like this—and the society would have got along\\r\\npretty well had it not been for the fact that there were a certain\\r\\nnumber of the members who could be bought. They got to be an infernal\\r\\nnuisance. Every time we had an election the candidates had to go\\r\\naround and see the purchasable members. The price per vote was paid in\\r\\ndoughnuts, and it depended somewhat on the appetites of the individuals\\r\\nas to the price of the votes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis thing ran along until some of us, the really very best boys in the\\r\\norganization, decided that these corrupt practices must stop, and for\\r\\nthe purpose of stopping them we organized a third party. We had a name,\\r\\nbut we were never known by that name. Those who didn’t like us called us\\r\\nthe Anti-Doughnut party, but we didn’t mind that.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe said: “Call us what you please; the name doesn’t matter. We are\\r\\norganized for a principle.” By-and-by the election came around, and\\r\\nwe made a big mistake. We were triumphantly beaten. That taught us a\\r\\nlesson. Then and there we decided never again to nominate anybody\\r\\nfor anything. We decided simply to force the other two parties in the\\r\\nsociety to nominate their very best men. Although we were organized for\\r\\na principle, we didn’t care much about that. Principles aren’t of much\\r\\naccount anyway, except at election-time. After that you hang them up to\\r\\nlet them season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next time we had an election we told both the other parties that\\r\\nwe’d beat any candidates put up by any one of them of whom we didn’t\\r\\napprove. In that election we did business. We got the man we wanted. I\\r\\nsuppose they called us the Anti-Doughnut party because they couldn’t buy\\r\\nus with their doughnuts. They didn’t have enough of them. Most reformers\\r\\narrive at their price sooner or later, and I suppose we would have had\\r\\nour price; but our opponents weren’t offering anything but doughnuts,\\r\\nand those we spurned.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it seems to me that an Anti-Doughnut party is just what is wanted\\r\\nin the present emergency. I would have the Anti-Doughnuts felt in every\\r\\ncity and hamlet and school district in this State and in the United\\r\\nStates. I was an Anti-Doughnut in my boyhood, and I’m an Anti-Doughnut\\r\\nstill. The modern designation is Mugwump. There used to be quite a\\r\\nnumber of us Mugwumps, but I think I’m the only one left. I had a vote\\r\\nthis fall, and I began to make some inquiries as to what I had better do\\r\\nwith it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t know anything about finance, and I never did, but I know some\\r\\npretty shrewd financiers, and they told me that Mr. Bryan wasn’t safe on\\r\\nany financial question. I said to myself, then, that it wouldn’t do\\r\\nfor me to vote for Bryan, and I rather thought—I know now—that McKinley\\r\\nwasn’t just right on this Philippine question, and so I just didn’t vote\\r\\nfor anybody. I’ve got that vote yet, and I’ve kept it clean, ready to\\r\\ndeposit at some other election. It wasn’t cast for any wildcat financial\\r\\ntheories, and it wasn’t cast to support the man who sends our boys as\\r\\nvolunteers out into the Philippines to get shot down under a polluted\\r\\nflag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT\\r\\n\\r\\nADDRESS AT THE ANNUAL DINNER OF THE ST. NICHOLAS SOCIETY, NEW YORK,\\r\\nDECEMBER 6, 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Doctor Mackay, in his response to the toast “St. Nicholas,”\\r\\n           referred to Mr. Clemens, saying:--“Mark Twain is as true a\\r\\n          preacher of true righteousness as any bishop, priest, or\\r\\n          minister of any church to-day, because he moves men to forget\\r\\n          their faults by cheerful well-doing instead of making them sour\\r\\n          and morbid by everlastingly bending their attention to the\\r\\n          seamy and sober side of life.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE ST. NICHOLAS SOCIETY,—These are,\\r\\nindeed, prosperous days for me. Night before last, in a speech, the\\r\\nBishop of the Diocese of New York complimented me for my contribution to\\r\\ntheology, and to-night the Reverend Doctor Mackay has elected me to the\\r\\nministry. I thanked Bishop Potter then for his compliment, and I thank\\r\\nDoctor Mackay now for that promotion. I think that both have discerned\\r\\nin me what I long ago discerned, but what I was afraid the world would\\r\\nnever learn to recognize.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this absence of nine years I find a great improvement in the city of\\r\\nNew York. I am glad to speak on that as a toast—“The City of New York.”\\r\\n Some say it has improved because I have been away. Others, and I agree\\r\\nwith them, say it has improved because I have come back. We must judge\\r\\nof a city, as of a man, by its external appearances and by its inward\\r\\ncharacter. In externals the foreigner coming to these shores is more\\r\\nimpressed at first by our sky-scrapers. They are new to him. He has\\r\\nnot done anything of the sort since he built the tower of Babel. The\\r\\nforeigner is shocked by them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the daylight they are ugly. They are—well, too chimneyfied and too\\r\\nsnaggy—like a mouth that needs attention from a dentist; like a cemetery\\r\\nthat is all monuments and no gravestones. But at night, seen from the\\r\\nriver where they are columns towering against the sky, all sparkling\\r\\nwith light, they are fairylike; they are beauty more satisfactory to the\\r\\nsoul and more enchanting than anything that man has dreamed of since the\\r\\nArabian nights. We can’t always have the beautiful aspect of things. Let\\r\\nus make the most of our sights that are beautiful and let the others go.\\r\\nWhen your foreigner makes disagreeable comments on New York by daylight,\\r\\nfloat him down the river at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat has made these sky-scrapers possible is the elevator. The cigar-box\\r\\nwhich the European calls a “lift” needs but to be compared with our\\r\\nelevators to be appreciated. The lift stops to reflect between floors.\\r\\nThat is all right in a hearse, but not in elevators. The American\\r\\nelevator acts like the man’s patent purge—it worked. As the inventor\\r\\nsaid, “This purge doesn’t waste any time fooling around; it attends\\r\\nstrictly to business.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat New-Yorkers have the cleanest, quickest, and most admirable system\\r\\nof street railways in the world has been forced upon you by the abnormal\\r\\nappreciation you have of your hackman. We ought always to be grateful to\\r\\nhim for that service. Nobody else would have brought such a system into\\r\\nexistence for us. We ought to build him a monument. We owe him one as\\r\\nmuch as we owe one to anybody. Let it be a tall one. Nothing permanent,\\r\\nof course; build it of plaster, say. Then gaze at it and realize how\\r\\ngrateful we are—for the time being—and then pull it down and throw it on\\r\\nthe ash-heap. That’s the way to honor your public heroes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to our streets, I find them cleaner than they used to be. I miss\\r\\nthose dear old landmarks, the symmetrical mountain ranges of dust and\\r\\ndirt that used to be piled up along the streets for the wind and rain\\r\\nto tear down at their pleasure. Yes, New York is cleaner than Bombay. I\\r\\nrealize that I have been in Bombay, that I now am in New York; that it\\r\\nis not my duty to flatter Bombay, but rather to flatter New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompared with the wretched attempts of London to light that city, New\\r\\nYork may fairly be said to be a well-lighted city. Why, London’s attempt\\r\\nat good lighting is almost as bad as London’s attempt at rapid transit.\\r\\nThere is just one good system of rapid transit in London—the “Tube,” and\\r\\nthat, of course, had been put in by Americans. Perhaps, after a while,\\r\\nthose Americans will come back and give New York also a good underground\\r\\nsystem. Perhaps they have already begun. I have been so busy since I\\r\\ncame back that I haven’t had time as yet to go down cellar.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is by the laws of the city, it is by the manners of the city, it\\r\\nis by the ideals of the city, it is by the customs of the city and by\\r\\nthe municipal government which all these elements correct, support, and\\r\\nfoster, by which the foreigner judges the city. It is by these that he\\r\\nrealizes that New York may, indeed, hold her head high among the cities\\r\\nof the world. It is by these standards that he knows whether to class\\r\\nthe city higher or lower than the other municipalities of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nGentlemen, you have the best municipal government in the world—the\\r\\npurest and the most fragrant. The very angels envy you, and wish they\\r\\ncould establish a government like it in heaven. You got it by a noble\\r\\nfidelity to civic duty. You got it by stern and ever-watchful exertion\\r\\nof the great powers with which you are charged by the rights which were\\r\\nhanded down to you by your forefathers, by your manly refusal to let\\r\\nbase men invade the high places of your government, and by instant\\r\\nretaliation when any public officer has insulted you in the city’s name\\r\\nby swerving in the slightest from the upright and full performance of\\r\\nhis duty. It is you who have made this city the envy of the cities of\\r\\nthe world. God will bless you for it—God will bless you for it. Why,\\r\\nwhen you approach the final resting-place the angels of heaven will\\r\\ngather at the gates and cry out:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here they come! Show them to the archangel’s box, and turn the\\r\\nlime-light on them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHINA AND THE PHILIPPINES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          AT A DINNER GIVEN IN THE WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL, DECEMBER, 1900\\r\\n\\r\\n          Winston Spencer Churchill was introduced by Mr. Clemens.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor years I’ve been a self-appointed missionary to bring about the union\\r\\nof America and the motherland. They ought to be united. Behold America,\\r\\nthe refuge of the oppressed from everywhere (who can pay fifty dollars’\\r\\nadmission)—any one except a Chinaman—standing up for human rights\\r\\neverywhere, even helping China let people in free when she wants to\\r\\ncollect fifty dollars upon them. And how unselfishly England has wrought\\r\\nfor the open door for all! And how piously America has wrought for that\\r\\nopen door in all cases where it was not her own!\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, as a missionary I’ve sung my songs of praise. And yet I think that\\r\\nEngland sinned when she got herself into a war in South Africa which she\\r\\ncould have avoided, just as we sinned in getting into a similar war in\\r\\nthe Philippines. Mr. Churchill, by his father, is an Englishman; by his\\r\\nmother he is an American—no doubt a blend that makes the perfect man.\\r\\nEngland and America; yes, we are kin. And now that we are also kin in\\r\\nsin, there is nothing more to be desired. The harmony is complete, the\\r\\nblend is perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEORETICAL MORALS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          The New Vagabonds Club of London, made up of the leading\\r\\n          younger literary men of the day, gave a dinner in honor of Mr.\\r\\n          and Mrs. Clemens, July 8, 1899.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has always been difficult—leave that word difficult—not exceedingly\\r\\ndifficult, but just difficult, nothing more than that, not the slightest\\r\\nshade to add to that—just difficult—to respond properly, in the right\\r\\nphraseology, when compliments are paid to me; but it is more than\\r\\ndifficult when the compliments are paid to a better than I—my wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while I am not here to testify against myself—I can’t be expected\\r\\nto do so, a prisoner in your own country is not admitted to do so—as to\\r\\nwhich member of the family wrote my books, I could say in general that\\r\\nreally I wrote the books myself. My wife puts the facts in, and they\\r\\nmake it respectable. My modesty won’t suffer while compliments are being\\r\\npaid to literature, and through literature to my family. I can’t get\\r\\nenough of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am curiously situated to-night. It so rarely happens that I am\\r\\nintroduced by a humorist; I am generally introduced by a person of\\r\\ngrave walk and carriage. That makes the proper background of gravity\\r\\nfor brightness. I am going to alter to suit, and haply I may say some\\r\\nhumorous things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you start with a blaze of sunshine and upburst of humor, when you\\r\\nbegin with that, the proper office of humor is to reflect, to put you\\r\\ninto that pensive mood of deep thought, to make you think of your sins,\\r\\nif you wish half an hour to fly. Humor makes me reflect now to-night, it\\r\\nsets the thinking machinery in motion. Always, when I am thinking, there\\r\\ncome suggestions of what I am, and what we all are, and what we are\\r\\ncoming to. A sermon comes from my lips always when I listen to a\\r\\nhumorous speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nI seize the opportunity to throw away frivolities, to say something to\\r\\nplant the seed, and make all better than when I came. In Mr. Grossmith’s\\r\\nremarks there was a subtle something suggesting my favorite theory of\\r\\nthe difference between theoretical morals and practical morals. I try to\\r\\ninstil practical morals in the place of theatrical—I mean theoretical;\\r\\nbut as an addendum—an annex—something added to theoretical morals.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen your chairman said it was the first time he had ever taken the\\r\\nchair, he did not mean that he had not taken lots of other things;\\r\\nhe attended my first lecture and took notes. This indicated the man’s\\r\\ndisposition. There was nothing else flying round, so he took notes; he\\r\\nwould have taken anything he could get.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can bring a moral to bear here which shows the difference between\\r\\ntheoretical morals and practical morals. Theoretical morals are the sort\\r\\nyou get on your mother’s knee, in good books, and from the pulpit. You\\r\\ngather them in your head, and not in your heart; they are theory without\\r\\npractice. Without the assistance of practice to perfect them, it is\\r\\ndifficult to teach a child to “be honest, don’t steal.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI will teach you how it should be done, lead you into temptation, teach\\r\\nyou how to steal, so that you may recognize when you have stolen and\\r\\nfeel the proper pangs. It is no good going round and bragging you have\\r\\nnever taken the chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs by the fires of experience, so by commission of crime, you learn real\\r\\nmorals. Commit all the crimes, familiarize yourself with all sins, take\\r\\nthem in rotation (there are only two or three thousand of them), stick\\r\\nto it, commit two or three every day, and by-and-by you will be proof\\r\\nagainst them. When you are through you will be proof against all sins\\r\\nand morally perfect. You will be vaccinated against every possible\\r\\ncommission of them. This is the only way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will read you a written statement upon the subject that I wrote three\\r\\nyears ago to read to the Sabbath-schools. [Here the lecturer turned his\\r\\npockets out, but without success.] No! I have left it at home. Still, it\\r\\nwas a mere statement of fact, illustrating the value of practical morals\\r\\nproduced by the commission of crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in my boyhood just a statement of fact, reading is only more\\r\\nformal, merely facts, merely pathetic facts, which I can state so as to\\r\\nbe understood. It relates to the first time I ever stole a watermelon;\\r\\nthat is, I think it was the first time; anyway, it was right along there\\r\\nsomewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stole it out of a farmer’s wagon while he was waiting on another\\r\\ncustomer. “Stole” is a harsh term. I withdrew—I retired that watermelon.\\r\\nI carried it to a secluded corner of a lumber-yard. I broke it open. It\\r\\nwas green—the greenest watermelon raised in the valley that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minute I saw it was green I was sorry, and began to\\r\\nreflect—reflection is the beginning of reform. If you don’t reflect when\\r\\nyou commit a crime then that crime is of no use; it might just as well\\r\\nhave been committed by some one else: You must reflect or the value is\\r\\nlost; you are not vaccinated against committing it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to reflect. I said to myself: “What ought a boy to do who has\\r\\nstolen a green watermelon? What would George Washington do, the father\\r\\nof his country, the only American who could not tell a lie? What would\\r\\nhe do? There is only one right, high, noble thing for any boy to do who\\r\\nhas stolen a watermelon of that class: he must make restitution; he must\\r\\nrestore that stolen property to its rightful owner.” I said I would do\\r\\nit when I made that good resolution. I felt it to be a noble, uplifting\\r\\nobligation. I rose up spiritually stronger and refreshed. I carried that\\r\\nwatermelon back—what was left of it—and restored it to the farmer, and\\r\\nmade him give me a ripe one in its place.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you see that this constant impact of crime upon crime protects\\r\\nyou against further commission of crime. It builds you up. A man can’t\\r\\nbecome morally perfect by stealing one or a thousand green watermelons,\\r\\nbut every little helps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was at a great school yesterday (St. Paul’s), where for four hundred\\r\\nyears they have been busy with brains, and building up England by\\r\\nproducing Pepys, Miltons, and Marlboroughs. Six hundred boys left to\\r\\nnothing in the world but theoretical morality. I wanted to become the\\r\\nprofessor of practical morality, but the high master was away, so I\\r\\nsuppose I shall have to go on making my living the same old way—by\\r\\nadding practical to theoretical morality.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome, compared\\r\\nto the glory and grandeur and majesty of a perfected morality such as\\r\\nyou see before you?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Vagabonds are old vagabonds (undergoing the old sort of reform).\\r\\nYou drank my health; I hope I have not been unuseful. Take this system\\r\\nof morality to your hearts. Take it home to your neighbors and your\\r\\ngraves, and I hope that it will be a long time before you arrive there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLAYMAN’S SERMON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          The Young Men’s Christian Association asked Mr. Clemens to\\r\\n          deliver a lay sermon at the Majestic Theatre, New York, March\\r\\n          4, 1906.  More than five thousand young men tried to get into\\r\\n          the theatre, and in a short time traffic was practically\\r\\n          stopped in the adjacent streets.  The police reserves had to be\\r\\n          called out to thin the crowd.  Doctor Fagnani had said\\r\\n          something before about the police episode, and Mr. Clemens took\\r\\n          it up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been listening to what was said here, and there is in it a lesson\\r\\nof citizenship. You created the police, and you are responsible for\\r\\nthem. One must pause, therefore, before criticising them too harshly.\\r\\nThey are citizens, just as we are. A little of citizenship ought to\\r\\nbe taught at the mother’s knee and in the nursery. Citizenship is what\\r\\nmakes a republic; monarchies can get along without it. What keeps a\\r\\nrepublic on its legs is good citizenship.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganization is necessary in all things. It is even necessary in reform.\\r\\nI was an organization myself once—for twelve hours. I was in Chicago\\r\\na few years ago about to depart for New York. There were with me Mr.\\r\\nOsgood, a publisher, and a stenographer. I picked out a state-room on\\r\\na train, the principal feature of which was that it contained the\\r\\nprivilege of smoking. The train had started but a short time when the\\r\\nconductor came in and said that there had been a mistake made, and asked\\r\\nthat we vacate the apartment. I refused, but when I went out on the\\r\\nplatform Osgood and the stenographer agreed to accept a section. They\\r\\nwere too modest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I am not modest. I was born modest, but it didn’t last. I asserted\\r\\nmyself; insisted upon my rights, and finally the Pullman Conductor and\\r\\nthe train conductor capitulated, and I was left in possession.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went into the dining-car the next morning for breakfast. Ordinarily I\\r\\nonly care for coffee and rolls, but this particular morning I espied\\r\\nan important-looking man on the other side of the car eating broiled\\r\\nchicken. I asked for broiled chicken, and I was told by the waiter and\\r\\nlater by the dining-car conductor that there was no broiled chicken.\\r\\nThere must have been an argument, for the Pullman conductor came in and\\r\\nremarked: “If he wants broiled chicken, give it to him. If you\\r\\nhaven’t got it on the train, stop somewhere. It will be better for all\\r\\nconcerned!” I got the chicken.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is from experiences such as these that you get your education of\\r\\nlife, and you string them into jewels or into tinware, as you may\\r\\nchoose. I have received recently several letters asking my counsel\\r\\nor advice. The principal request is for some incident that may prove\\r\\nhelpful to the young. There were a lot of incidents in my career to help\\r\\nme along—sometimes they helped me along faster than I wanted to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is such a request. It is a telegram from Joplin, Missouri, and\\r\\nit reads: “In what one of your works can we find the definition of a\\r\\ngentleman?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not answered that telegram, either; I couldn’t. It seems to me\\r\\nthat if any man has just merciful and kindly instincts he would be a\\r\\ngentleman, for he would need nothing else in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI received the other day a letter from my old friend, William Dean\\r\\nHowells—Howells, the head of American literature. No one is able to\\r\\nstand with him. He is an old, old friend of mine, and he writes me,\\r\\n“To-morrow I shall be sixty-nine years old.” Why, I am surprised at\\r\\nHowells writing that! I have known him longer than that. I’m sorry to\\r\\nsee a man trying to appear so young. Let’s see. Howells says now, “I see\\r\\nyou have been burying Patrick. I suppose he was old, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, he was never old—Patrick. He came to us thirty-six years ago. He was\\r\\nmy coachman on the morning that I drove my young bride to our new home.\\r\\nHe was a young Irishman, slender, tall, lithe, honest, truthful, and\\r\\nhe never changed in all his life. He really was with us but twenty-five\\r\\nyears, for he did not go with us to Europe, but he never regarded that\\r\\nas separation. As the children grew up he was their guide. He was all\\r\\nhonor, honesty, and affection. He was with us in New Hampshire, with us\\r\\nlast summer, and his hair was just as black, his eyes were just as blue,\\r\\nhis form just as straight, and his heart just as good as on the day we\\r\\nfirst met. In all the long years Patrick never made a mistake. He never\\r\\nneeded an order, he never received a command. He knew. I have been asked\\r\\nfor my idea of an ideal gentleman, and I give it to you Patrick McAleer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUNIVERSITY SETTLEMENT SOCIETY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          After the serious addresses were made, Seth Low introduced Mr.\\r\\n          Clemens at the Settlement House, February 2, 1901.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe older we grow the greater becomes our wonder at how much ignorance\\r\\none can contain without bursting one’s clothes. Ten days ago I did not\\r\\nknow anything about the University Settlement except what I’d read in\\r\\nthe pamphlets sent me. Now, after being here and hearing Mrs. Hewitt\\r\\nand Mrs. Thomas, it seems to me I know of nothing like it at all. It’s a\\r\\ncharity that carries no humiliation with it. Marvellous it is, to think\\r\\nof schools where you don’t have to drive the children in but drive them\\r\\nout. It was not so in my day.\\r\\n\\r\\nDown-stairs just now I saw a dancing lesson going on. You must pay a\\r\\ncent for a lesson. You can’t get it for nothing. That’s the reason I\\r\\nnever learned to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was the pawnbroker’s shop you have here that interested me\\r\\nmightily. I’ve known something about pawnbrokers’ shops in my time,\\r\\nbut here you have a wonderful plan. The ordinary pawnbroker charges\\r\\nthirty-six per cent. a year for a loan, and I’ve paid more myself, but\\r\\nhere a man or woman in distress can obtain a loan for one per cent. a\\r\\nmonth! It’s wonderful!\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve been interested in all I’ve heard to-day, especially in the\\r\\nromances recounted by Mrs. Thomas, which reminds me that I have a\\r\\nromance of my own in my autobiography, which I am building for the\\r\\ninstruction of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn San Francisco, many years ago, when I was a newspaper reporter\\r\\n(perhaps I should say I had been and was willing to be), a pawnbroker\\r\\nwas taking care of what property I had. There was a friend of mine, a\\r\\npoet, out of a job, and he was having a hard time of it, too. There was\\r\\npassage in it, but I guess I’ve got to keep that for the autobiography.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, my friend the poet thought his life was a failure, and I told\\r\\nhim I thought it was, and then he said he thought he ought to commit\\r\\nsuicide, and I said “all right,” which was disinterested advice to a\\r\\nfriend in trouble; but, like all such advice, there was just a little\\r\\nbit of self-interest back of it, for if I could get a “scoop” on the\\r\\nother newspapers I could get a job.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet could be spared, and so, largely for his own good and partly\\r\\nfor mine, I kept the thing in his mind, which was necessary, as would-be\\r\\nsuicides are very changeable and hard to hold to their purpose. He had a\\r\\npreference for a pistol, which was an extravagance, for we hadn’t enough\\r\\nbetween us to hire a pistol. A fork would have been easier.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so he concluded to drown himself, and I said it was an excellent\\r\\nidea—the only trouble being that he was so good a swimmer. So we went\\r\\ndown to the beach. I went along to see that the thing was done right.\\r\\nThen something most romantic happened. There came in on the sea\\r\\nsomething that had been on its way for three years. It rolled in across\\r\\nthe broad Pacific with a message that was full of meaning to that poor\\r\\npoet and cast itself at his feet. It was a life-preserver! This was a\\r\\ncomplication. And then I had an idea—he never had any, especially\\r\\nwhen he was going to write poetry; I suggested that we pawn the\\r\\nlife-preserver and get a revolver.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pawnbroker gave us an old derringer with a bullet as big as a\\r\\nhickory nut. When he heard that it was only a poet that was going to\\r\\nkill himself he did not quibble. Well, we succeeded in sending a bullet\\r\\nright through his head. It was a terrible moment when he placed that\\r\\npistol against his forehead and stood for an instant. I said, “Oh, pull\\r\\nthe trigger!” and he did, and cleaned out all the gray matter in his\\r\\nbrains. It carried the poetic faculty away, and now he’s a useful member\\r\\nof society.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, therefore, I realize that there’s no more beneficent institution\\r\\nthan this penny fund of yours, and I want all the poets to know this. I\\r\\ndid think about writing you a check, but now I think I’ll send you a few\\r\\ncopies of what one of your little members called ‘Strawberry Finn’.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIC EDUCATION ASSOCIATION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT A MEETING OF THE BERKELEY LYCEUM, NEW YORK,\\r\\n          NOVEMBER 23, 1900\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t suppose that I am called here as an expert on education, for\\r\\nthat would show a lack of foresight on your part and a deliberate\\r\\nintention to remind me of my shortcomings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I sat here looking around for an idea it struck me that I was called\\r\\nfor two reasons. One was to do good to me, a poor unfortunate traveller\\r\\non the world’s wide ocean, by giving me a knowledge of the nature and\\r\\nscope of your society and letting me know that others beside myself have\\r\\nbeen of some use in the world. The other reason that I can see is\\r\\nthat you have called me to show by way of contrast what education can\\r\\naccomplish if administered in the right sort of doses.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour worthy president said that the school pictures, which have received\\r\\nthe admiration of the world at the Paris Exposition, have been sent to\\r\\nRussia, and this was a compliment from that Government—which is very\\r\\nsurprising to me. Why, it is only an hour since I read a cablegram\\r\\nin the newspapers beginning “Russia Proposes to Retrench.” I was not\\r\\nexpecting such a thunderbolt, and I thought what a happy thing it\\r\\nwill be for Russians when the retrenchment will bring home the thirty\\r\\nthousand Russian troops now in Manchuria, to live in peaceful pursuits.\\r\\nI thought this was what Germany should do also without delay, and that\\r\\nFrance and all the other nations in China should follow suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should not China be free from the foreigners, who are only making\\r\\ntrouble on her soil? If they would only all go home, what a pleasant\\r\\nplace China would be for the Chinese! We do not allow Chinamen to come\\r\\nhere, and I say in all seriousness that it would be a graceful thing to\\r\\nlet China decide who shall go there.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina never wanted foreigners any more than foreigners wanted Chinamen,\\r\\nand on this question I am with the Boxers every time. The Boxer is a\\r\\npatriot. He loves his country better than he does the countries of other\\r\\npeople. I wish him success. The Boxer believes in driving us out of\\r\\nhis country. I am a Boxer too, for I believe in driving him out of our\\r\\ncountry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I read the Russian despatch further my dream of world peace\\r\\nvanished. It said that the vast expense of maintaining the army had\\r\\nmade it necessary to retrench, and so the Government had decided that\\r\\nto support the army it would be necessary to withdraw the appropriation\\r\\nfrom the public schools. This is a monstrous idea to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe that out of the public school grows the greatness of a\\r\\nnation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is curious to reflect how history repeats itself the world over. Why,\\r\\nI remember the same thing was done when I was a boy on the Mississippi\\r\\nRiver. There was a proposition in a township there to discontinue public\\r\\nschools because they were too expensive. An old farmer spoke up and said\\r\\nif they stopped the schools they would not save anything, because every\\r\\ntime a school was closed a jail had to be built.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s like feeding a dog on his own tail. He’ll never get fat. I believe\\r\\nit is better to support schools than jails.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work of your association is better and shows more wisdom than the\\r\\nCzar of Russia and all his people. This is not much of a compliment, but\\r\\nit’s the best I’ve got in stock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEDUCATION AND CITIZENSHIP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          On the evening of May 14, 1908, the alumni of the College of\\r\\n          the City of New York celebrated the opening of the new college\\r\\n          buildings at a banquet in the Waldorf Astoria.  Mr. Clemens\\r\\n          followed Mayor McClellan.\\r\\n\\r\\nI agreed when the Mayor said that there was not a man within hearing who\\r\\ndid not agree that citizenship should be placed above everything else,\\r\\neven learning.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave you ever thought about this? Is there a college in the whole\\r\\ncountry where there is a chair of good citizenship? There is a kind\\r\\nof bad citizenship which is taught in the schools, but no real good\\r\\ncitizenship taught. There are some which teach insane citizenship,\\r\\nbastard citizenship, but that is all. Patriotism! Yes; but patriotism\\r\\nis usually the refuge of the scoundrel. He is the man who talks the\\r\\nloudest.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can begin that chair of citizenship in the College of the City of\\r\\nNew York. You can place it above mathematics and literature, and that is\\r\\nwhere it belongs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe used to trust in God. I think it was in 1863 that some genius\\r\\nsuggested that it be put upon the gold and silver coins which circulated\\r\\namong the rich. They didn’t put it on the nickels and coppers because\\r\\nthey didn’t think the poor folks had any trust in God.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood citizenship would teach accuracy of thinking and accuracy of\\r\\nstatement. Now, that motto on the coin is an overstatement. Those\\r\\nCongressmen had no right to commit this whole country to a theological\\r\\ndoctrine. But since they did, Congress ought to state what our creed\\r\\nshould be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was never a nation in the world that put its whole trust in\\r\\nGod. It is a statement made on insufficient evidence. Leaving out the\\r\\ngamblers, the burglars, and the plumbers, perhaps we do put our trust in\\r\\nGod after a fashion. But, after all, it is an overstatement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the cholera or black plague should come to these shores, perhaps\\r\\nthe bulk of the nation would pray to be delivered from it, but the rest\\r\\nwould put their trust in the Health Board of the City of New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nI read in the papers within the last day or two of a poor young girl who\\r\\nthey said was a leper. Did the people in that populous section of the\\r\\ncountry where she was—did they put their trust in God? The girl was\\r\\nafflicted with the leprosy, a disease which cannot be communicated from\\r\\none person to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, instead of putting their trust in God, they harried that poor\\r\\ncreature, shelterless and friendless, from place to place, exactly as\\r\\nthey did in the Middle Ages, when they made lepers wear bells, so that\\r\\npeople could be warned of their approach and avoid them. Perhaps those\\r\\npeople in the Middle Ages thought they were putting their trust in God.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President ordered the removal of that motto from the coin, and I\\r\\nthought that it was well. I thought that overstatement should not stay\\r\\nthere. But I think it would better read, “Within certain judicious\\r\\nlimitations we trust in God,” and if there isn’t enough room on the coin\\r\\nfor this, why, enlarge the coin.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I want to tell a story about jumping at conclusions. It was told\\r\\nto me by Bram Stoker, and it concerns a christening. There was a little\\r\\nclergyman who was prone to jump at conclusions sometimes. One day he\\r\\nwas invited to officiate at a christening. He went. There sat\\r\\nthe relatives—intelligent-looking relatives they were. The little\\r\\nclergyman’s instinct came to him to make a great speech. He was given to\\r\\nflights of oratory that way—a very dangerous thing, for often the wings\\r\\nwhich take one into clouds of oratorical enthusiasm are wax and melt up\\r\\nthere, and down you come.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the little clergyman couldn’t resist. He took the child in his arms,\\r\\nand, holding it, looked at it a moment. It wasn’t much of a child.\\r\\nIt was little, like a sweet-potato. Then the little clergyman waited\\r\\nimpressively, and then: “I see in your countenances,” he said,\\r\\n“disappointment of him. I see you are disappointed with this baby. Why?\\r\\nBecause he is so little. My friends, if you had but the power of looking\\r\\ninto the future you might see that great things may come of little\\r\\nthings. There is the great ocean, holding the navies of the world, which\\r\\ncomes from little drops of water no larger than a woman’s tears. There\\r\\nare the great constellations in the sky, made up of little bits of\\r\\nstars. Oh, if you could consider his future you might see that he might\\r\\nbecome the greatest poet of the universe, the greatest warrior the world\\r\\nhas ever known, greater than Caesar, than Hannibal, than—er—er” (turning\\r\\nto the father)—“what’s his name?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father hesitated, then whispered back: “His name? Well, his name is\\r\\nMary Ann.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOURAGE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          At a beefsteak dinner, given by artists, caricaturists, and\\r\\n          humorists of New York City, April 18, 1908, Mr. Clemens, Mr. H.\\r\\n          H. Rogers, and Mr. Patrick McCarren were the guests of honor.\\r\\n          Each wore a white apron, and each made a short speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the matter of courage we all have our limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere never was a hero who did not have his bounds. I suppose it may be\\r\\nsaid of Nelson and all the others whose courage has been advertised that\\r\\nthere came times in their lives when their bravery knew it had come to\\r\\nits limit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have found mine a good many times. Sometimes this was expected—often\\r\\nit was unexpected. I know a man who is not afraid to sleep with a\\r\\nrattlesnake, but you could not get him to sleep with a safety-razor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI never had the courage to talk across a long, narrow room. I should\\r\\nbe at the end of the room facing all the audience. If I attempt to\\r\\ntalk across a room I find myself turning this way and that, and thus at\\r\\nalternate periods I have part of the audience behind me. You ought never\\r\\nto have any part of the audience behind you; you never can tell what\\r\\nthey are going to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll sit down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DINNER TO MR. CHOATE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          AT A DINNER GIVEN IN HONOR OF AMBASSADOR JOSEPH H. CHOATE AT\\r\\n          THE LOTOS CLUB, NOVEMBER 24, 1902\\r\\n\\r\\n          The speakers, among others, were: Senator Depew, William Henry\\r\\n          White, Speaker Thomas Reed, and Mr. Choate.  Mr. Clemens spoke,\\r\\n          in part, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatness of this country rests on two anecdotes. The first one is\\r\\nthat of Washington and his hatchet, representing the foundation of true\\r\\nspeaking, which is the characteristic of our people. The second one is\\r\\nan old one, and I’ve been waiting to hear it to-night; but as nobody has\\r\\ntold it yet, I will tell it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou’ve heard it before, and you’ll hear it many, many times more. It is\\r\\nan anecdote of our guest, of the time when he was engaged as a young man\\r\\nwith a gentle Hebrew, in the process of skinning the client. The main\\r\\npart in that business is the collection of the bill for services in\\r\\nskinning the man. “Services” is the term used in that craft for the\\r\\noperation of that kind-diplomatic in its nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nChoate’s—co-respondent—made out a bill for $500 for his services, so\\r\\ncalled. But Choate told him he had better leave the matter to him,\\r\\nand the next day he collected the bill for the services and handed the\\r\\nHebrew $5000, saying, “That’s your half of the loot,” and inducing that\\r\\nmemorable response: “Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deep-thinkers didn’t merely laugh when that happened. They stopped\\r\\nto think, and said “There’s a rising man. He must be rescued from the\\r\\nlaw and consecrated to diplomacy. The commercial advantages of a great\\r\\nnation lie there in that man’s keeping. We no longer require a man to\\r\\ntake care of our moral character before the world. Washington and his\\r\\nanecdote have done that. We require a man to take care of our commercial\\r\\nprosperity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Choate has carried that trait with him, and, as Mr. Carnegie has\\r\\nsaid, he has worked like a mole underground.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see the result when American railroad iron is sold so cheap in\\r\\nEngland that the poorest family can have it. He has so beguiled that\\r\\nCabinet of England.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has been spreading the commerce of this nation, and has depressed\\r\\nEnglish commerce in the same ratio. This was the principle underlying\\r\\nthat anecdote, and the wise men saw it; the principle of give and\\r\\ntake—give one and take ten—the principle of diplomacy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nON STANLEY AND LIVINGSTONE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens was entertained at dinner by the Whitefriars’ Club,\\r\\n          London, at the Mitre Tavern, on the evening of August 6, 1872.\\r\\n          In reply to the toast in his honor he said:\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMEN,—I thank you very heartily indeed for this expression of\\r\\nkindness toward me. What I have done for England and civilization in the\\r\\narduous affairs which I have engaged in (that is good: that is so smooth\\r\\nthat I will say it again and again)—what I have done for England and\\r\\ncivilization in the arduous part I have performed I have done with a\\r\\nsingle-hearted devotion and with no hope of reward. I am proud, I am\\r\\nvery proud, that it was reserved for me to find Doctor Livingstone and\\r\\nfor Mr. Stanley to get all the credit. I hunted for that man in Africa\\r\\nall over seventy-five or one hundred parishes, thousands and thousands\\r\\nof miles in the wilds and deserts all over the place, sometimes riding\\r\\nnegroes and sometimes travelling by rail. I didn’t mind the rail or\\r\\nanything else, so that I didn’t come in for the tar and feathers. I\\r\\nfound that man at Ujiji—a place you may remember if you have ever been\\r\\nthere—and it was a very great satisfaction that I found him just in the\\r\\nnick of time. I found that poor old man deserted by his niggers and\\r\\nby his geographers, deserted by all of his kind except the\\r\\ngorillas—dejected, miserable, famishing, absolutely famishing—but he\\r\\nwas eloquent. Just as I found him he had eaten his last elephant, and\\r\\nhe said to me: “God knows where I shall get another.” He had nothing to\\r\\nwear except his venerable and honorable naval suit, and nothing to eat\\r\\nbut his diary.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I said to him: “It is all right; I have discovered you, and Stanley\\r\\nwill be here by the four-o’clock train and will discover you officially,\\r\\nand then we will turn to and have a reg’lar good time.” I said: “Cheer\\r\\nup, for Stanley has got corn, ammunition, glass beads, hymn-books,\\r\\nwhiskey, and everything which the human heart can desire; he has got all\\r\\nkinds of valuables, including telegraph-poles and a few cart-loads of\\r\\nmoney. By this time communication has been made with the land of Bibles\\r\\nand civilization, and property will advance.” And then we surveyed\\r\\nall that country, from Ujiji, through Unanogo and other places, to\\r\\nUnyanyembe. I mention these names simply for your edification, nothing\\r\\nmore—do not expect it—particularly as intelligence to the Royal\\r\\nGeographical Society. And then, having filled up the old man, we were\\r\\nall too full for utterance and departed. We have since then feasted on\\r\\nhonors.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley has received a snuff-box and I have received considerable snuff;\\r\\nhe has got to write a book and gather in the rest of the credit, and\\r\\nI am going to levy on the copyright and to collect the money. Nothing\\r\\ncomes amiss to me—cash or credit; but, seriously, I do feel that Stanley\\r\\nis the chief man and an illustrious one, and I do applaud him with all\\r\\nmy heart. Whether he is an American or a Welshman by birth, or one,\\r\\nor both, matters not to me. So far as I am personally concerned, I am\\r\\nsimply here to stay a few months, and to see English people and to learn\\r\\nEnglish manners and customs, and to enjoy myself; so the simplest thing\\r\\nI can do is to thank you for the toast you have honored me with and\\r\\nfor the remarks you have made, and to wish health and prosperity to the\\r\\nWhitefriars’ Club, and to sink down to my accustomed level.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHENRY M. STANLEY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS DELIVERED IN BOSTON, NOVEMBER, 1886\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens introduced Mr. Stanley.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN, if any should ask, Why is it that you are here as\\r\\nintroducer of the lecturer? I should answer that I happened to be around\\r\\nand was asked to perform this function. I was quite willing to do so,\\r\\nand, as there was no sort of need of an introduction, anyway, it could\\r\\nbe necessary only that some person come forward for a moment and do an\\r\\nunnecessary thing, and this is quite in my line. Now, to introduce so\\r\\nillustrious a name as Henry M. Stanley by any detail of what the man\\r\\nhas done is clear aside from my purpose; that would be stretching the\\r\\nunnecessary to an unconscionable degree. When I contrast what I have\\r\\nachieved in my measurably brief life with what he has achieved in his\\r\\npossibly briefer one, the effect is to sweep utterly away the ten-story\\r\\nedifice of my own self-appreciation and leave nothing behind but the\\r\\ncellar. When you compare these achievements of his with the achievements\\r\\nof really great men who exist in history, the comparison, I believe, is\\r\\nin his favor. I am not here to disparage Columbus.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, I won’t do that; but when you come to regard the achievements\\r\\nof these two men, Columbus and Stanley, from the standpoint of the\\r\\ndifficulties they encountered, the advantage is with Stanley and against\\r\\nColumbus. Now, Columbus started out to discover America. Well, he didn’t\\r\\nneed to do anything at all but sit in the cabin of his ship and hold his\\r\\ngrip and sail straight on, and America would discover itself. Here\\r\\nit was, barring his passage the whole length and breadth of the South\\r\\nAmerican continent, and he couldn’t get by it. He’d got to discover it.\\r\\nBut Stanley started out to find Doctor Livingstone, who was scattered\\r\\nabroad, as you may say, over the length and breadth of a vast slab of\\r\\nAfrica as big as the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a blind kind of search. He was the worst scattered of men. But\\r\\nI will throw the weight of this introduction upon one very peculiar\\r\\nfeature of Mr. Stanley’s character, and that is his indestructible\\r\\nAmericanism—an Americanism which he is proud of. And in this day and\\r\\ntime, when it is the custom to ape and imitate English methods and\\r\\nfashion, it is like a breath of fresh air to stand in the presence of\\r\\nthis untainted American citizen who has been caressed and complimented\\r\\nby half of the crowned heads of Europe who could clothe his body from\\r\\nhis head to his heels with the orders and decorations lavished upon\\r\\nhim. And yet, when the untitled myriads of his own country put out their\\r\\nhands in welcome to him and greet him, “Well done,” through the Congress\\r\\nof the United States, that is the crown that is worth all the rest to\\r\\nhim. He is a product of institutions which exist in no other country on\\r\\nearth-institutions that bring out all that is best and most heroic in a\\r\\nman. I introduce Henry M. Stanley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDINNER TO MR. JEROME\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          A dinner to express their confidence in the integrity and good\\r\\n          judgment of District-Attorney Jerome was given at Delmonico’s\\r\\n          by over three hundred of his admirers on the evening of May 7,\\r\\n          1909.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, that is very sudden. I was not informed that the verdict\\r\\nwas going to depend upon my judgment, but that makes not the least\\r\\ndifference in the world when you already know all about it. It is not\\r\\nany matter when you are called upon to express it; you can get up and do\\r\\nit, and my verdict has already been recorded in my heart and in my head\\r\\nas regards Mr. Jerome and his administration of the criminal affairs of\\r\\nthis county.\\r\\n\\r\\nI agree with everything Mr. Choate has said in his letter regarding Mr.\\r\\nJerome; I agree with everything Mr. Shepard has said; and I agree with\\r\\neverything Mr. Jerome has said in his own commendation. And I thought\\r\\nMr. Jerome was modest in that. If he had been talking about another\\r\\nofficer of this county, he could have painted the joys and sorrows of\\r\\noffice and his victories in even stronger language than he did.\\r\\n\\r\\nI voted for Mr. Jerome in those old days, and I should like to vote for\\r\\nhim again if he runs for any office. I moved out of New York, and that\\r\\nis the reason, I suppose, I cannot vote for him again. There may be some\\r\\nway, but I have not found it out. But now I am a farmer—a farmer up in\\r\\nConnecticut, and winning laurels. Those people already speak with such\\r\\nhigh favor, admiration, of my farming, and they say that I am the only\\r\\nman that has ever come to that region who could make two blades of grass\\r\\ngrow where only three grew before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I cannot vote for him. You see that. As it stands now, I cannot.\\r\\nI am crippled in that way and to that extent, for I would ever so much\\r\\nlike to do it. I am not a Congress, and I cannot distribute pensions,\\r\\nand I don’t know any other legitimate way to buy a vote. But if I should\\r\\nthink of any legitimate way, I shall make use of it, and then I shall\\r\\nvote for Mr. Jerome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHENRY IRVING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          The Dramatic and Literary Society of London gave a welcome-home\\r\\n          dinner to Sir Henry Irving at the Savoy Hotel, London, June 9,\\r\\n          1900.  In proposing the toast of “The Drama” Mr. Clemens said:\\r\\n\\r\\nI find my task a very easy one. I have been a dramatist for thirty\\r\\nyears. I have had an ambition in all that time to overdo the work of the\\r\\nSpaniard who said he left behind him four hundred dramas when he died. I\\r\\nleave behind me four hundred and fifteen, and am not yet dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatest of all the arts is to write a drama. It is a most difficult\\r\\nthing. It requires the highest talent possible and the rarest gifts.\\r\\nNo, there is another talent that ranks with it—for anybody can write a\\r\\ndrama—I had four hundred of them—but to get one accepted requires real\\r\\nability. And I have never had that felicity yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut human nature is so constructed, we are so persistent, that when we\\r\\nknow that we are born to a thing we do not care what the world thinks\\r\\nabout it. We go on exploiting that talent year after year, as I have\\r\\ndone. I shall go on writing dramas, and some day the impossible may\\r\\nhappen, but I am not looking for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn writing plays the chief thing is novelty. The world grows tired of\\r\\nsolid forms in all the arts. I struck a new idea myself years ago. I was\\r\\nnot surprised at it. I was always expecting it would happen. A person\\r\\nwho has suffered disappointment for many years loses confidence, and I\\r\\nthought I had better make inquiries before I exploited my new idea of\\r\\ndoing a drama in the form of a dream, so I wrote to a great authority on\\r\\nknowledge of all kinds, and asked him whether it was new.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could depend upon him. He lived in my dear home in America—that dear\\r\\nhome, dearer to me through taxes. He sent me a list of plays in which\\r\\nthat old device had been used, and he said that there was also a modern\\r\\nlot. He travelled back to China and to a play dated two thousand six\\r\\nhundred years before the Christian era. He said he would follow it up\\r\\nwith a list of the previous plays of the kind, and in his innocence\\r\\nwould have carried them back to the Flood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the most discouraging thing that has ever happened to me in my\\r\\ndramatic career. I have done a world of good in a silent and private\\r\\nway, and have furnished Sir Henry Irving with plays and plays and plays.\\r\\nWhat has he achieved through that influence? See where he stands now—on\\r\\nthe summit of his art in two worlds and it was I who put him there—that\\r\\npartly put him there.\\r\\n\\r\\nI need not enlarge upon the influence the drama has exerted upon\\r\\ncivilization. It has made good morals entertaining. I am to be followed\\r\\nby Mr. Pinero. I conceive that we stand at the head of the profession.\\r\\nHe has not written as many plays as I have, but he has lead that\\r\\nGod-given talent, which I lack, of working them off on the manager. I\\r\\ncouple his name with this toast, and add the hope that his influence\\r\\nwill be supported in exercising his masterly handicraft in that great\\r\\ngift, and that he will long live to continue his fine work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDINNER TO HAMILTON W. MABIE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS DELIVERED APRIL 29, 1901\\r\\n\\r\\n          In introducing Mr. Clemens, Doctor Van Dyke said:\\r\\n\\r\\n          “The longer the speaking goes on to-night the more I wonder how\\r\\n          I got this job, and the only explanation I can give for it is\\r\\n          that it is the same kind of compensation for the number of\\r\\n          articles I have sent to The Outlook, to be rejected by Hamilton\\r\\n          W. Mabie.  There is one man here to-night that has a job cut\\r\\n          out for him that none of you would have had--a man whose humor\\r\\n          has put a girdle of light around the globe, and whose sense of\\r\\n          humor has been an example for all five continents.  He is going\\r\\n          to speak to you.  Gentlemen, you know him best as Mark Twain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN,—This man knows now how it feels to be the\\r\\nchief guest, and if he has enjoyed it he is the first man I have ever\\r\\nseen in that position that did enjoy it. And I know, by side-remarks\\r\\nwhich he made to me before his ordeal came upon him, that he was feeling\\r\\nas some of the rest of us have felt under the same circumstances. He was\\r\\nafraid that he would not do himself justice; but he did—to my surprise.\\r\\nIt is a most serious thing to be a chief guest on an occasion like this,\\r\\nand it is admirable, it is fine. It is a great compliment to a man\\r\\nthat he shall come out of it so gloriously as Mr. Mabie came out of it\\r\\ntonight—to my surprise. He did it well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe appears to be editor of The Outlook, and notwithstanding that, I\\r\\nhave every admiration, because when everything is said concerning The\\r\\nOutlook, after all one must admit that it is frank in its delinquencies,\\r\\nthat it is outspoken in its departures from fact, that it is vigorous\\r\\nin its mistaken criticisms of men like me. I have lived in this world a\\r\\nlong, long time, and I know you must not judge a man by the editorials\\r\\nthat he puts in his paper. A man is always better than his printed\\r\\nopinions. A man always reserves to himself on the inside a purity and an\\r\\nhonesty and a justice that are a credit to him, whereas the things that\\r\\nhe prints are just the reverse.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh yes, you must not judge a man by what he writes in his paper. Even in\\r\\nan ordinary secular paper a man must observe some care about it; he must\\r\\nbe better than the principles which he puts in print. And that is\\r\\nthe case with Mr. Mabie. Why, to see what he writes about me and the\\r\\nmissionaries you would think he did not have any principles. But that is\\r\\nMr. Mabie in his public capacity. Mr. Mabie in his private capacity is\\r\\njust as clean a man as I am.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this very room, a month or two ago, some people admired that\\r\\nportrait; some admired this, but the great majority fastened on that,\\r\\nand said, “There is a portrait that is a beautiful piece of art.” When\\r\\nthat portrait is a hundred years old it will suggest what were the\\r\\nmanners and customs in our time. Just as they talk about Mr. Mabie\\r\\nto-night, in that enthusiastic way, pointing out the various virtues of\\r\\nthe man and the grace of his spirit, and all that, so was that portrait\\r\\ntalked about. They were enthusiastic, just as we men have been over the\\r\\ncharacter and the work of Mr. Mabie. And when they were through they\\r\\nsaid that portrait, fine as it is, that work, beautiful as it is, that\\r\\npiece of humanity on that canvas, gracious and fine as it is, does not\\r\\nrise to those perfections that exist in the man himself. Come up, Mr.\\r\\nAlexander. [The reference was to James W. Alexander, who happened to be\\r\\nsitting—beneath the portrait of himself on the wall.] Now, I should come\\r\\nup and show myself. But he cannot do it, he cannot do it. He was born\\r\\nthat way, he was reared in that way. Let his modesty be an example,\\r\\nand I wish some of you had it, too. But that is just what I have been\\r\\nsaying—that portrait, fine as it is, is not as fine as the man it\\r\\nrepresents, and all the things that have been said about Mr. Mabie, and\\r\\ncertainly they have been very nobly worded and beautiful, still fall\\r\\nshort of the real Mabie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINTRODUCING NYE AND RILEY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          James Whitcomb Riley and Edgar Wilson Nye (Bill Nye) were to\\r\\n          give readings in Tremont Temple, Boston, November, 1888.  Mr.\\r\\n          Clemens was induced to introduce Messrs. Riley and Nye.  His\\r\\n          appearance on the platform was a surprise to the audience, and\\r\\n          when they recognized him there was a tremendous demonstration.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very glad indeed to introduce these young people to you, and at the\\r\\nsame time get acquainted with them myself. I have seen them more than\\r\\nonce for a moment, but have not had the privilege of knowing them\\r\\npersonally as intimately as I wanted to. I saw them first, a great many\\r\\nyears ago, when Mr. Barnum had them, and they were just fresh from Siam.\\r\\nThe ligature was their best hold then, the literature became their best\\r\\nhold later, when one of them committed an indiscretion, and they had to\\r\\ncut the old bond to accommodate the sheriff.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that old former time this one was Chang, that one was Eng. The\\r\\nsympathy existing between the two was most extraordinary; it was so\\r\\nfine, so strong, so subtle, that what the one ate the other digested;\\r\\nwhen one slept, the other snored; if one sold a thing, the other scooped\\r\\nthe usufruct. This independent and yet dependent action was observable\\r\\nin all the details of their daily life—I mean this quaint and arbitrary\\r\\ndistribution of originating cause and resulting effect between the\\r\\ntwo—between, I may say, this dynamo and the other always motor, or,\\r\\nin other words, that the one was always the creating force, the other\\r\\nalways the utilizing force; no, no, for while it is true that within\\r\\ncertain well-defined zones of activity the one was always dynamo and\\r\\nthe other always motor, within certain other well-defined zones these\\r\\npositions became exactly reversed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, in moral matters Mr. Chang Riley was always dynamo, Mr.\\r\\nEng Nye was always motor; for while Mr. Chang Riley had a high—in fact,\\r\\nan abnormally high and fine moral sense, he had no machinery to work\\r\\nit with; whereas, Mr. Eng Nye, who hadn’t any moral sense at all, and\\r\\nhasn’t yet, was equipped with all the necessary plant for putting a\\r\\nnoble deed through, if he could only get the inspiration on reasonable\\r\\nterms outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn intellectual matters, on the other hand, Mr. Eng Nye was always\\r\\ndynamo, Mr. Chang Riley was always motor; Mr. Eng Nye had a stately\\r\\nintellect, but couldn’t make it go; Mr. Chang Riley hadn’t, but could.\\r\\nThat is to say, that while Mr. Chang Riley couldn’t think things\\r\\nhimself, he had a marvellous natural grace in setting them down and\\r\\nweaving them together when his pal furnished the raw material.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, working together, they made a strong team; laboring together, they\\r\\ncould do miracles; but break the circuit, and both were impotent. It has\\r\\nremained so to this day: they must travel together, hoe, and plant, and\\r\\nplough, and reap, and sell their public together, or there’s no result.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have made this explanation, this analysis, this vivisection, so\\r\\nto speak, in order that you may enjoy these delightful adventurers\\r\\nunderstandingly. When Mr. Eng Nye’s deep and broad and limpid\\r\\nphilosophies flow by in front of you, refreshing all the regions round\\r\\nabout with their gracious floods, you will remember that it isn’t his\\r\\nwater; it’s the other man’s, and he is only working the pump. And when\\r\\nMr. Chang Riley enchants your ear, and soothes your spirit, and touches\\r\\nyour heart with the sweet and genuine music of his poetry—as sweet and\\r\\nas genuine as any that his friends, the birds and the bees, make about\\r\\nhis other friends, the woods and the flowers—you will remember, while\\r\\nplacing justice where justice is due, that it isn’t his music, but the\\r\\nother man’s—he is only turning the crank.\\r\\n\\r\\nI beseech for these visitors a fair field, a singleminded, one-eyed\\r\\numpire, and a score bulletin barren of goose-eggs if they earn it—and I\\r\\njudge they will and hope they will. Mr. James Whitcomb Chang Riley will\\r\\nnow go to the bat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDINNER TO WHITELAW REID\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE DINNER IN HONOR OF AMBASSADOR REID, GIVEN BY THE\\r\\n          PILGRIMS’ CLUB OF NEW YORK ON FEBRUARY 19, 1908\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very proud to respond to this toast, as it recalls the proudest day\\r\\nof my life. The delightful hospitality shown me at the time of my visit\\r\\nto Oxford I shall cherish until I die. In that long and distinguished\\r\\ncareer of mine I value that degree above all other honors. When the ship\\r\\nlanded even the stevedores gathered on the shore and gave an English\\r\\ncheer. Nothing could surpass in my life the pleasure of those four\\r\\nweeks. No one could pass by me without taking my hand, even the\\r\\npolicemen. I’ve been in all the principal capitals of Christendom in my\\r\\nlife, and have always been an object of interest to policemen. Sometimes\\r\\nthere was suspicion in their eyes, but not always. With their puissant\\r\\nhand they would hold up the commerce of the world to let me pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nI noticed in the papers this afternoon a despatch from Washington,\\r\\nsaying that Congress would immediately pass a bill restoring to our gold\\r\\ncoinage the motto “In God We Trust.” I’m glad of that; I’m glad of\\r\\nthat. I was troubled when that motto was removed. Sure enough, the\\r\\nprosperities of the whole nation went down in a heap when we ceased to\\r\\ntrust in God in that conspicuously advertised way. I knew there would\\r\\nbe trouble. And if Pierpont Morgan hadn’t stepped in—Bishop Lawrence may\\r\\nnow add to his message to the old country that we are now trusting in\\r\\nGod again. So we can discharge Mr. Morgan from his office with honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Reid said an hour or so ago something about my ruining my activities\\r\\nlast summer. They are not ruined, they are renewed. I am stronger\\r\\nnow—much stronger. I suppose that the spiritual uplift I received\\r\\nincreased my physical power more than anything I ever had before. I was\\r\\ndancing last night at 2.30 o’clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Choate has mentioned Mr. Reid’s predecessors. Mr. Choate’s head is\\r\\nfull of history, and some of it is true, too. I enjoyed hearing him tell\\r\\nabout the list of the men who had the place before he did. He mentioned\\r\\na long list of those predecessors, people I never heard of before, and\\r\\nelected five of them to the Presidency by his own vote. I’m glad and\\r\\nproud to find Mr. Reid in that high position, because he didn’t look it\\r\\nwhen I knew him forty years ago. I was talking to Reid the other day,\\r\\nand he showed me my autograph on an old paper twenty years old. I didn’t\\r\\nknow I had an autograph twenty years ago. Nobody ever asked me for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember a dinner I had long ago with Whitelaw Reid and John Hay at\\r\\nReid’s expense. I had another last summer when I was in London at the\\r\\nembassy that Choate blackguards so. I’d like to live there.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people say they couldn’t live on the salary, but I could live on\\r\\nthe salary and the nation together. Some of us don’t appreciate what\\r\\nthis country can do. There’s John Hay, Reid, Choate, and me. This is the\\r\\nonly country in the world where youth, talent, and energy can reach such\\r\\nheights. It shows what we could do without means, and what people can do\\r\\nwith talent and energy when they find it in people like us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I first came to New York they were all struggling young men, and I\\r\\nam glad to see that they have got on in the world. I knew John Hay when\\r\\nI had no white hairs in my head and more hair than Reid has now.\\r\\nThose were days of joy and hope. Reid and Hay were on the staff of the\\r\\nTribune. I went there once in that old building, and I looked all around\\r\\nand I finally found a door ajar and looked in. It wasn’t Reid or Hay\\r\\nthere, but it was Horace Greeley. Those were in the days when Horace\\r\\nGreeley was a king. That was the first time I ever saw him and the last.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was admiring him when he stopped and seemed to realize that there was\\r\\na fine presence there somewhere. He tried to smile, but he was out of\\r\\nsmiles. He looked at me a moment, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What in H—-do you want?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began with that word “H.” That’s a long word and a profane word. I\\r\\ndon’t remember what the word was now, but I recognized the power of\\r\\nit. I had never used that language myself, but at that moment I was\\r\\nconverted. It has been a great refuge for me in time of trouble. If a\\r\\nman doesn’t know that language he can’t express himself on strenuous\\r\\noccasions. When you have that word at your command let trouble come.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut later Hay rose, and you know what summit Whitelaw Reid has reached,\\r\\nand you see me. Those two men have regulated troubles of nations and\\r\\nconferred peace upon mankind. And in my humble way, of which I am quite\\r\\nvain, I was the principal moral force in all those great international\\r\\nmovements. These great men illustrated what I say. Look at us great\\r\\npeople—we all come from the dregs of society. That’s what can be done in\\r\\nthis country. That’s what this country does for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nChoate here—he hasn’t got anything to say, but he says it just the\\r\\nsame, and he can do it so felicitously, too. I said long ago he was the\\r\\nhandsomest man America ever produced. May the progress of civilization\\r\\nalways rest on such distinguished men as it has in the past!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nROGERS AND RAILROADS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          AT A BANQUET GIVEN MR. H. H. ROGERS BY THE BUSINESS MEN OF\\r\\n          NORFOLK, VA., CELEBRATING THE OPENING OF THE VIRGINIAN RAILWAY,\\r\\n          APRIL, 3, 1909\\r\\n\\r\\n          Toastmaster:\\r\\n\\r\\n          “I have often thought that when the time comes, which must come\\r\\n          to all of us, when we reach that Great Way in the Great Beyond,\\r\\n          and the question is propounded, ‘What have you done to gain\\r\\n          admission into this great realm?’ if the answer could be\\r\\n          sincerely made, ‘I have made men laugh,’ it would be the surest\\r\\n          passport to a welcome entrance.  We have here to-night one who\\r\\n          has made millions laugh--not the loud laughter that bespeaks\\r\\n          the vacant mind, but the laugh of intelligent mirth that helps\\r\\n          the human heart and the human mind.  I refer, of course, to\\r\\n          Doctor Clemens.  I was going to say Mark Twain, his literary\\r\\n          title, which is a household phrase in more homes than that of\\r\\n          any other man, and you know him best by that dear old title.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI thank you, Mr. Toastmaster, for the compliment which you have paid me,\\r\\nand I am sure I would rather have made people laugh than cry, yet in my\\r\\ntime I have made some of them cry; and before I stop entirely I hope to\\r\\nmake some more of them cry. I like compliments. I deal in them myself.\\r\\nI have listened with the greatest pleasure to the compliments which the\\r\\nchairman has paid to Mr. Rogers and that road of his to-night, and I\\r\\nhope some of them are deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no small distinction to a man like that to sit here before an\\r\\nintelligent crowd like this and to be classed with Napoleon and Caesar.\\r\\nWhy didn’t he say that this was the proudest day of his life? Napoleon\\r\\nand Caesar are dead, and they can’t be here to defend themselves. But\\r\\nI’m here!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chairman said, and very truly, that the most lasting thing in the\\r\\nhands of man are the roads which Caesar built, and it is true that he\\r\\nbuilt a lot of them; and they are there yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, Caesar built a lot of roads in England, and you can find them. But\\r\\nRogers has only built one road, and he hasn’t finished that yet. I\\r\\nlike to hear my old friend complimented, but I don’t like to hear it\\r\\noverdone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t go around to-day with the others to see what he is doing. I\\r\\nwill do that in a quiet time, when there is not anything going on, and\\r\\nwhen I shall not be called upon to deliver intemperate compliments on a\\r\\nrailroad in which I own no stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey proposed that I go along with the committee and help inspect that\\r\\ndump down yonder. I didn’t go. I saw that dump. I saw that thing when I\\r\\nwas coming in on the steamer, and I didn’t go because I was diffident,\\r\\nsentimentally diffident, about going and looking at that thing\\r\\nagain—that great, long, bony thing; it looked just like Mr. Rogers’s\\r\\nfoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chairman says Mr. Rogers is full of practical wisdom, and he is.\\r\\nIt is intimated here that he is a very ingenious man, and he is a very\\r\\ncompetent financier. Maybe he is now, but it was not always so. I know\\r\\nlots of private things in his life which people don’t know, and I know\\r\\nhow he started; and it was not a very good start. I could have done\\r\\nbetter myself. The first time he crossed the Atlantic he had just made\\r\\nthe first little strike in oil, and he was so young he did not like to\\r\\nask questions. He did not like to appear ignorant. To this day he don’t\\r\\nlike to appear ignorant, but he can look as ignorant as anybody. On\\r\\nboard the ship they were betting on the run of the ship, betting a\\r\\ncouple of shillings, or half a crown, and they proposed that this youth\\r\\nfrom the oil regions should bet on the run of the ship. He did not like\\r\\nto ask what a half-crown was, and he didn’t know; but rather than be\\r\\nashamed of himself he did bet half a crown on the run of the ship, and\\r\\nin bed he could not sleep. He wondered if he could afford that outlay in\\r\\ncase he lost. He kept wondering over it, and said to himself: “A king’s\\r\\ncrown must be worth $20,000, so half a crown would cost $10,000.” He\\r\\ncould not afford to bet away $10,000 on the run of the ship, so he went\\r\\nup to the stakeholder and gave him $150 to let him off.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like to hear Mr. Rogers complimented. I am not stingy in compliments\\r\\nto him myself. Why, I did it to-day when I sent his wife a telegram to\\r\\ncomfort her. That is the kind of person I am. I knew she would be uneasy\\r\\nabout him. I knew she would be solicitous about what he might do down\\r\\nhere, so I did it to quiet her and to comfort her. I said he was doing\\r\\nwell for a person out of practice. There is nothing like it. He is like\\r\\nI used to be. There were times when I was careless—careless in my dress\\r\\nwhen I got older. You know how uncomfortable your wife can get when you\\r\\nare going away without her superintendence. Once when my wife could not\\r\\ngo with me (she always went with me when she could—I always did meet\\r\\nthat kind of luck), I was going to Washington once, a long time ago, in\\r\\nMr. Cleveland’s first administration, and she could not go; but, in her\\r\\nanxiety that I should not desecrate the house, she made preparation.\\r\\nShe knew that there was to be a reception of those authors at the White\\r\\nHouse at seven o’clock in the evening. She said, “If I should tell you\\r\\nnow what I want to ask of you, you would forget it before you get to\\r\\nWashington, and, therefore, I have written it on a card, and you\\r\\nwill find it in your dress-vest pocket when you are dressing at the\\r\\nArlington—when you are dressing to see the President.” I never thought\\r\\nof it again until I was dressing, and I felt in that pocket and took it\\r\\nout, and it said, in a kind of imploring way, “Don’t wear your arctics\\r\\nin the White House.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYou complimented Mr. Rogers on his energy, his foresightedness,\\r\\ncomplimented him in various ways, and he has deserved those compliments,\\r\\nalthough I say it myself; and I enjoy them all. There is one side of Mr.\\r\\nRogers that has not been mentioned. If you will leave that to me I will\\r\\ntouch upon that. There was a note in an editorial in one of the Norfolk\\r\\npapers this morning that touched upon that very thing, that hidden side\\r\\nof Mr. Rogers, where it spoke of Helen Keller and her affection for Mr.\\r\\nRogers, to whom she dedicated her life book. And she has a right to\\r\\nfeel that way, because, without the public knowing anything about it,\\r\\nhe rescued, if I may use that term, that marvellous girl, that wonderful\\r\\nSouthern girl, that girl who was stone deaf, blind, and dumb from\\r\\nscarlet-fever when she was a baby eighteen months old; and who now is as\\r\\nwell and thoroughly educated as any woman on this planet at twenty-nine\\r\\nyears of age. She is the most marvellous person of her sex that has\\r\\nexisted on this earth since Joan of Arc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is not all Mr. Rogers has done; but you never see that side of his\\r\\ncharacter, because it is never protruding; but he lends a helping hand\\r\\ndaily out of that generous heart of his. You never hear of it. He is\\r\\nsupposed to be a moon which has one side dark and the other bright. But\\r\\nthe other side, though you don’t see it, is not dark; it is bright, and\\r\\nits rays penetrate, and others do see it who are not God.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would take this opportunity to tell something that I have never been\\r\\nallowed to tell by Mr. Rogers, either by my mouth or in print, and if I\\r\\ndon’t look at him I can tell it now.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1893, when the publishing company of Charles L. Webster, of which\\r\\nI was financial agent, failed, it left me heavily in debt. If you will\\r\\nremember what commerce was at that time you will recall that you could\\r\\nnot sell anything, and could not buy anything, and I was on my back;\\r\\nmy books were not worth anything at all, and I could not give away my\\r\\ncopyrights. Mr. Rogers had long enough vision ahead to say, “Your books\\r\\nhave supported you before, and after the panic is over they will support\\r\\nyou again,” and that was a correct proposition. He saved my copyrights,\\r\\nand saved me from financial ruin. He it was who arranged with my\\r\\ncreditors to allow me to roam the face of the earth for four years and\\r\\npersecute the nations thereof with lectures, promising that at the end\\r\\nof four years I would pay dollar for dollar. That arrangement was made;\\r\\notherwise I would now be living out-of-doors under an umbrella, and a\\r\\nborrowed one at that.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see his white mustache and his head trying to get white (he is\\r\\nalways trying to look like me—I don’t blame him for that). These are\\r\\nonly emblematic of his character, and that is all. I say, without\\r\\nexception, hair and all, he is the whitest man I have ever known.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OLD-FASHIONED PRINTER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE TYPOTHETAE DINNER GIVEN AT DELMONICO’S,\\r\\n          JANUARY 18, 1886, COMMEMORATING THE BIRTHDAY OF\\r\\n          BENJAMIN FRANKLIN\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens responded to the toast “The Compositor.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chairman’s historical reminiscences of Gutenberg have caused me to\\r\\nfall into reminiscences, for I myself am something of an antiquity. All\\r\\nthings change in the procession of years, and it may be that I am among\\r\\nstrangers. It may be that the printer of to-day is not the printer of\\r\\nthirty-five years ago. I was no stranger to him. I knew him well. I\\r\\nbuilt his fire for him in the winter mornings; I brought his water from\\r\\nthe village pump; I swept out his office; I picked up his type from\\r\\nunder his stand; and, if he were there to see, I put the good type in\\r\\nhis case and the broken ones among the “hell matter”; and if he wasn’t\\r\\nthere to see, I dumped it all with the “pi” on the imposing-stone—for\\r\\nthat was the furtive fashion of the cub, and I was a cub. I wetted down\\r\\nthe paper Saturdays, I turned it Sundays—for this was a country weekly;\\r\\nI rolled, I washed the rollers, I washed the forms, I folded the papers,\\r\\nI carried them around at dawn Thursday mornings. The carrier was then\\r\\nan object of interest to all the dogs in town. If I had saved up all\\r\\nthe bites I ever received, I could keep M. Pasteur busy for a year.\\r\\nI enveloped the papers that were for the mail—we had a hundred\\r\\ntown subscribers and three hundred and fifty country ones; the town\\r\\nsubscribers paid in groceries and the country ones in cabbages and\\r\\ncord-wood—when they paid at all, which was merely sometimes, and then\\r\\nwe always stated the fact in the paper, and gave them a puff; and if we\\r\\nforgot it they stopped the paper. Every man on the town list helped\\r\\nedit the thing—that is, he gave orders as to how it was to be edited;\\r\\ndictated its opinions, marked out its course for it, and every time the\\r\\nboss failed to connect he stopped his paper. We were just infested with\\r\\ncritics, and we tried to satisfy them all over. We had one subscriber\\r\\nwho paid cash, and he was more trouble than all the rest. He bought\\r\\nus once a year, body and soul, for two dollars. He used to modify our\\r\\npolitics every which way, and he made us change our religion four times\\r\\nin five years. If we ever tried to reason with him, he would threaten to\\r\\nstop his paper, and, of course, that meant bankruptcy and destruction.\\r\\nThat man used to write articles a column and a half long, leaded long\\r\\nprimer, and sign them “Junius,” or “Veritas,” or “Vox Populi,” or some\\r\\nother high-sounding rot; and then, after it was set up, he would come\\r\\nin and say he had changed his mind-which was a gilded figure of speech,\\r\\nbecause he hadn’t any—and order it to be left out. We couldn’t afford\\r\\n“bogus” in that office, so we always took the leads out, altered the\\r\\nsignature, credited the article to the rival paper in the next village,\\r\\nand put it in. Well, we did have one or two kinds of “bogus.” Whenever\\r\\nthere was a barbecue, or a circus, or a baptizing, we knocked off for\\r\\nhalf a day, and then to make up for short matter we would “turn over\\r\\nads”—turn over the whole page and duplicate it. The other “bogus” was\\r\\ndeep philosophical stuff, which we judged nobody ever read; so we kept\\r\\na galley of it standing, and kept on slapping the same old batches of it\\r\\nin, every now and then, till it got dangerous. Also, in the early days\\r\\nof the telegraph we used to economize on the news. We picked out the\\r\\nitems that were pointless and barren of information and stood them on\\r\\na galley, and changed the dates and localities, and used them over and\\r\\nover again till the public interest in them was worn to the bone. We\\r\\nmarked the ads, but we seldom paid any attention to the marks afterward;\\r\\nso the life of a “td” ad and a “tf” ad was equally eternal. I have seen\\r\\na “td” notice of a sheriff’s sale still booming serenely along two years\\r\\nafter the sale was over, the sheriff dead, and the whole circumstance\\r\\nbecome ancient history. Most of the yearly ads were patent-medicine\\r\\nstereotypes, and we used to fence with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can see that printing-office of prehistoric times yet, with its horse\\r\\nbills on the walls, its “d” boxes clogged with tallow, because we\\r\\nalways stood the candle in the “k” box nights, its towel, which was\\r\\nnot considered soiled until it could stand alone, and other signs and\\r\\nsymbols that marked the establishment of that kind in the Mississippi\\r\\nValley; and I can see, also, the tramping “jour,” who flitted by in the\\r\\nsummer and tarried a day, with his wallet stuffed with one shirt and a\\r\\nhatful of handbills; for if he couldn’t get any type to set he would do\\r\\na temperance lecture. His way of life was simple, his needs not complex;\\r\\nall he wanted was plate and bed and money enough to get drunk on, and he\\r\\nwas satisfied. But it may be, as I have said, that I am among strangers,\\r\\nand sing the glories of a forgotten age to unfamiliar ears, so I will\\r\\n“make even” and stop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSOCIETY OF AMERICAN AUTHORS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          On November 15, 1900, the society gave a reception to Mr.\\r\\n          Clemens, who came with his wife and daughter.  So many members\\r\\n          surrounded the guests that Mr. Clemens asked: “Is this genuine\\r\\n          popularity or is it all a part of a prearranged programme?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,—It seems a most difficult thing for\\r\\nany man to say anything about me that is not complimentary. I don’t know\\r\\nwhat the charm is about me which makes it impossible for a person to say\\r\\na harsh thing about me and say it heartily, as if he was glad to say it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this thing keeps on it will make me believe that I am what these kind\\r\\nchairmen say of me. In introducing me, Judge Ransom spoke of my modesty\\r\\nas if he was envious of me. I would like to have one man come out\\r\\nflat-footed and say something harsh and disparaging of me, even if it\\r\\nwere true. I thought at one time, as the learned judge was speaking,\\r\\nthat I had found that man; but he wound up, like all the others, by\\r\\nsaying complimentary things.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am constructed like everybody else, and enjoy a compliment as well\\r\\nas any other fool, but I do like to have the other side presented. And\\r\\nthere is another side. I have a wicked side. Estimable friends who know\\r\\nall about it would tell you and take a certain delight in telling you\\r\\nthings that I have done, and things further that I have not repented.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real life that I live, and the real life that I suppose all of you\\r\\nlive, is a life of interior sin. That is what makes life valuable and\\r\\npleasant. To lead a life of undiscovered sin! That is true joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge Ransom seems to have all the virtues that he ascribes to me. But,\\r\\noh my! if you could throw an X-ray through him. We are a pair. I have\\r\\nmade a life-study of trying to appear to be what he seems to think I am.\\r\\nEverybody believes that I am a monument of all the virtues, but it is\\r\\nnothing of the sort. I am living two lives, and it keeps me pretty busy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome day there will be a chairman who will forget some of these merits\\r\\nof mine, and then he will make a speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have more personal vanity than modesty, and twice as much veracity as\\r\\nthe two put together.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen that fearless and forgetful chairman is found there will be another\\r\\nstory told. At the Press Club recently I thought that I had found\\r\\nhim. He started in in the way that I knew I should be painted with all\\r\\nsincerity, and was leading to things that would not be to my credit; but\\r\\nwhen he said that he never read a book of mine I knew at once that he\\r\\nwas a liar, because he never could have had all the wit and intelligence\\r\\nwith which he was blessed unless he had read my works as a basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like compliments. I like to go home and tell them all over again to\\r\\nthe members of my family. They don’t believe them, but I like to tell\\r\\nthem in the home circle, all the same. I like to dream of them if I can.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thank everybody for their compliments, but I don’t think that I am\\r\\npraised any more than I am entitled to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREADING-ROOM OPENING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          On October 13, 1900, Mr. Clemens made his last address\\r\\n          preceding his departure for America at Kensal Rise, London.\\r\\n\\r\\nI formally declare this reading-room open, and I think that the\\r\\nlegislature should not compel a community to provide itself with\\r\\nintelligent food, but give it the privilege of providing it if the\\r\\ncommunity so desires.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the community is anxious to have a reading-room it would put its hand\\r\\nin its pocket and bring out the penny tax. I think it a proof of the\\r\\nhealthy, moral, financial, and mental condition of the community if it\\r\\ntaxes itself for its mental food.\\r\\n\\r\\nA reading-room is the proper introduction to a library, leading up\\r\\nthrough the newspapers and magazines to other literature. What would we\\r\\ndo without newspapers?\\r\\n\\r\\nLook at the rapid manner in which the news of the Galveston disaster\\r\\nwas made known to the entire world. This reminds me of an episode\\r\\nwhich occurred fifteen years ago when I was at church in Hartford,\\r\\nConnecticut.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clergyman decided to make a collection for the survivors, if any. He\\r\\ndid not include me among the leading citizens who took the plates around\\r\\nfor collection. I complained to the governor of his lack of financial\\r\\ntrust in me, and he replied: “I would trust you myself—if you had a\\r\\nbell-punch.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have paid me many compliments, and I like to listen to compliments.\\r\\nI indorse all your chairman has said to you about the union of England\\r\\nand America. He also alluded to my name, of which I am rather fond.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little girl wrote me from New Zealand in a letter I received\\r\\nyesterday, stating that her father said my proper name was not Mark\\r\\nTwain but Samuel Clemens, but that she knew better, because Clemens was\\r\\nthe name of the man who sold the patent medicine, and his name was not\\r\\nMark. She was sure it was Mark Twain, because Mark is in the Bible and\\r\\nTwain is in the Bible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very glad to get that expression of confidence in my origin, and\\r\\nas I now know my name to be a scriptural one, I am not without hopes of\\r\\nmaking it worthy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLITERATURE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE ROYAL LITERARY FUND BANQUET, LONDON, MAY 4, 1900\\r\\n\\r\\n          Anthony Hope introduced Mr. Clemens to make the response to the\\r\\n          toast “Literature.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOPE has been able to deal adequately with this toast without\\r\\nassistance from me. Still, I was born generous. If he had advanced any\\r\\ntheories that needed refutation or correction I would have attended to\\r\\nthem, and if he had made any statements stronger than those which he is\\r\\nin the habit of making I would have dealt with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, I was surprised at the mildness of his statements. I could not\\r\\nhave made such statements if I had preferred to, because to exaggerate\\r\\nis the only way I can approximate to the truth. You cannot have a theory\\r\\nwithout principles. Principles is another name for prejudices. I have no\\r\\nprejudices in politics, religion, literature, or anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am now on my way to my own country to run for the presidency because\\r\\nthere are not yet enough candidates in the field, and those who have\\r\\nentered are too much hampered by their own principles, which are\\r\\nprejudices.\\r\\n\\r\\nI propose to go there to purify the political atmosphere. I am in favor\\r\\nof everything everybody is in favor of. What you should do is to satisfy\\r\\nthe whole nation, not half of it, for then you would only be half a\\r\\nPresident.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere could not be a broader platform than mine. I am in favor of\\r\\nanything and everything—of temperance and intemperance, morality and\\r\\nqualified immorality, gold standard and free silver.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have tried all sorts of things, and that is why I want to try the\\r\\ngreat position of ruler of a country. I have been in turn reporter,\\r\\neditor, publisher, author, lawyer, burglar. I have worked my way up, and\\r\\nwish to continue to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nI read to-day in a magazine article that Christendom issued last year\\r\\nfifty-five thousand new books. Consider what that means! Fifty-five\\r\\nthousand new books meant fifty-four thousand new authors. We are\\r\\ngoing to have them all on our hands to take care of sooner or later.\\r\\nTherefore, double your subscriptions to the literary fund!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISAPPEARANCE OF LITERATURE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE DINNER OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY CLUB, AT\\r\\n          SHERRY’S, NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 20, 1900\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens spoke to the toast “The Disappearance of\\r\\n          Literature.”  Doctor Gould presided, and in introducing\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens said that he (the speaker), when in Germany, had to\\r\\n          do a lot of apologizing for a certain literary man who was\\r\\n          taking what the Germans thought undue liberties with their\\r\\n          language.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn’t necessary for your chairman to apologize for me in Germany. It\\r\\nwasn’t necessary at all. Instead of that he ought to have impressed upon\\r\\nthose poor benighted Teutons the service I rendered them. Their language\\r\\nhad needed untangling for a good many years. Nobody else seemed to want\\r\\nto take the job, and so I took it, and I flatter myself that I made a\\r\\npretty good job of it. The Germans have an inhuman way of cutting up\\r\\ntheir verbs. Now a verb has a hard time enough of it in this world when\\r\\nit’s all together. It’s downright inhuman to split it up. But that’s\\r\\njust what those Germans do. They take part of a verb and put it down\\r\\nhere, like a stake, and they take the other part of it and put it away\\r\\nover yonder like another stake, and between these two limits they just\\r\\nshovel in German. I maintain that there is no necessity for apologizing\\r\\nfor a man who helped in a small way to stop such mutilation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have heard a discussion to-night on the disappearance of literature.\\r\\nThat’s no new thing. That’s what certain kinds of literature have been\\r\\ndoing for several years. The fact is, my friends, that the fashion in\\r\\nliterature changes, and the literary tailors have to change their cuts\\r\\nor go out of business. Professor Winchester here, if I remember fairly\\r\\ncorrectly what he said, remarked that few, if any, of the novels\\r\\nproduced to-day would live as long as the novels of Walter Scott. That\\r\\nmay be his notion. Maybe he is right; but so far as I am concerned, I\\r\\ndon’t care if they don’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Winchester also said something about there being no modern\\r\\nepics like Paradise Lost. I guess he’s right. He talked as if he was\\r\\npretty familiar with that piece of literary work, and nobody would\\r\\nsuppose that he never had read it. I don’t believe any of you have ever\\r\\nread Paradise Lost, and you don’t want to. That’s something that you\\r\\njust want to take on trust. It’s a classic, just as Professor Winchester\\r\\nsays, and it meets his definition of a classic—something that everybody\\r\\nwants to have read and nobody wants to read.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Trent also had a good deal to say about the disappearance of\\r\\nliterature. He said that Scott would outlive all his critics. I guess\\r\\nthat’s true. The fact of the business is, you’ve got to be one of two\\r\\nages to appreciate Scott. When you’re eighteen you can read Ivanhoe, and\\r\\nyou want to wait until you are ninety to read some of the rest. It takes\\r\\na pretty well-regulated, abstemious critic to live ninety years.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as much as these two gentlemen have talked about the disappearance\\r\\nof literature, they didn’t say anything about my books. Maybe they think\\r\\nthey’ve disappeared. If they do, that just shows their ignorance on the\\r\\ngeneral subject of literature. I am not as young as I was several years\\r\\nago, and maybe I’m not so fashionable, but I’d be willing to take\\r\\nmy chances with Mr. Scott to-morrow morning in selling a piece of\\r\\nliterature to the Century Publishing Company. And I haven’t got much of\\r\\na pull here, either. I often think that the highest compliment ever\\r\\npaid to my poor efforts was paid by Darwin through President Eliot, of\\r\\nHarvard College. At least, Eliot said it was a compliment, and I always\\r\\ntake the opinion of great men like college presidents on all such\\r\\nsubjects as that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went out to Cambridge one day a few years ago and called on President\\r\\nEliot. In the course of the conversation he said that he had just\\r\\nreturned from England, and that he was very much touched by what he\\r\\nconsidered the high compliment Darwin was paying to my books, and he\\r\\nwent on to tell me something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know that there is one room in Darwin’s house, his bedroom,\\r\\nwhere the housemaid is never allowed to touch two things? One is a\\r\\nplant he is growing and studying while it grows” (it was one of those\\r\\ninsect-devouring plants which consumed bugs and beetles and things for\\r\\nthe particular delectation of Mr. Darwin) “and the other some books that\\r\\nlie on the night table at the head of his bed. They are your books, Mr.\\r\\nClemens, and Mr. Darwin reads them every night to lull him to sleep.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friends, I thoroughly appreciated that compliment, and considered it\\r\\nthe highest one that was ever paid to me. To be the means of soothing to\\r\\nsleep a brain teeming with bugs and squirming things like Darwin’s was\\r\\nsomething that I had never hoped for, and now that he is dead I never\\r\\nhope to be able to do it again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NEW YORK PRESS CLUB DINNER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          AT THE ANNUAL DINNER, NOVEMBER 13, 1900\\r\\n\\r\\n          Col. William L. Brown, the former editor of the Daily News, as\\r\\n          president of the club, introduced Mr. Clemens as the principal\\r\\n          ornament of American literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must say that I have already begun to regret that I left my gun at\\r\\nhome. I’ve said so many times when a chairman has distressed me with\\r\\njust such compliments that the next time such a thing occurs I will\\r\\ncertainly use a gun on that chairman. It is my privilege to compliment\\r\\nhim in return. You behold before you a very, very old man. A cursory\\r\\nglance at him would deceive the most penetrating. His features seem to\\r\\nreveal a person dead to all honorable instincts—they seem to bear the\\r\\ntraces of all the known crimes, instead of the marks of a life spent for\\r\\nthe most part, and now altogether, in the Sunday-school of a life that\\r\\nmay well stand as an example to all generations that have risen or\\r\\nwill riz—I mean to say, will rise. His private character is altogether\\r\\nsuggestive of virtues which to all appearances he has not. If you\\r\\nexamine his past history you will find it as deceptive as his features,\\r\\nbecause it is marked all over with waywardness and misdemeanor—mere\\r\\neffects of a great spirit upon a weak body—mere accidents of a great\\r\\ncareer. In his heart he cherishes every virtue on the list of virtues,\\r\\nand he practises them all—secretly—always secretly. You all know him\\r\\nso well that there is no need for him to be introduced here. Gentlemen,\\r\\nColonel Brown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ALPHABET AND SIMPLIFIED SPELLING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE DINNER GIVEN TO MR. CARNEGIE AT THE DEDICATION\\r\\n          OF THE NEW YORK ENGINEERS’ CLUB, DECEMBER 9, 1907\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens was introduced by the president of the club, who,\\r\\n          quoting from the Mark Twain autobiography, recalled the day\\r\\n          when the distinguished writer came to New York with $3 in small\\r\\n          change in his pockets and a $10 bill sewed in his clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems to me that I was around here in the neighborhood of the Public\\r\\nLibrary about fifty or sixty years ago. I don’t deny the circumstance,\\r\\nalthough I don’t see how you got it out of my autobiography, which was\\r\\nnot to be printed until I am dead, unless I’m dead now. I had that $3 in\\r\\nchange, and I remember well the $10 which was sewed in my coat. I\\r\\nhave prospered since. Now I have plenty of money and a disposition to\\r\\nsquander it, but I can’t. One of those trust companies is taking care of\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as this is probably the last time that I shall be out after\\r\\nnightfall this winter, I must say that I have come here with a mission,\\r\\nand I would make my errand of value.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany compliments have been paid to Mr. Carnegie to-night. I was\\r\\nexpecting them. They are very gratifying to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been a guest of honor myself, and I know what Mr. Carnegie is\\r\\nexperiencing now. It is embarrassing to get compliments and compliments\\r\\nand only compliments, particularly when he knows as well as the rest of\\r\\nus that on the other side of him there are all sorts of things worthy of\\r\\nour condemnation.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust look at Mr. Carnegie’s face. It is fairly scintillating with\\r\\nfictitious innocence. You would think, looking at him, that he had\\r\\nnever committed a crime in his life. But no—look at his pestiferious\\r\\nsimplified spelling. You can’t any of you imagine what a crime that has\\r\\nbeen. Torquemada was nothing to Mr. Carnegie. That old fellow shed some\\r\\nblood in the Inquisition, but Mr. Carnegie has brought destruction to\\r\\nthe entire race. I know he didn’t mean it to be a crime, but it was,\\r\\njust the same. He’s got us all so we can’t spell anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trouble with him is that he attacked orthography at the wrong end.\\r\\nHe meant well, but he attacked the symptoms and not the cause of the\\r\\ndisease. He ought to have gone to work on the alphabet. There’s not\\r\\na vowel in it with a definite value, and not a consonant that you can\\r\\nhitch anything to. Look at the “h’s” distributed all around. There’s\\r\\n“gherkin.” What are you going to do with the “h” in that? What the\\r\\ndevil’s the use of “h” in gherkin, I’d like to know. It’s one thing I\\r\\nadmire the English for: they just don’t mind anything about them at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut look at the “pneumatics” and the “pneumonias” and the rest of them.\\r\\nA real reform would settle them once and for all, and wind up by giving\\r\\nus an alphabet that we wouldn’t have to spell with at all, instead of\\r\\nthis present silly alphabet, which I fancy was invented by a drunken\\r\\nthief. Why, there isn’t a man who doesn’t have to throw out about\\r\\nfifteen hundred words a day when he writes his letters because he can’t\\r\\nspell them! It’s like trying to do a St. Vitus’s dance with wooden legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I’ll bet there isn’t a man here who can spell “pterodactyl,” not\\r\\neven the prisoner at the bar. I’d like to hear him try once—but not\\r\\nin public, for it’s too near Sunday, when all extravagant histrionic\\r\\nentertainments are barred. I’d like to hear him try in private, and when\\r\\nhe got through trying to spell “pterodactyl” you wouldn’t know whether\\r\\nit was a fish or a beast or a bird, and whether it flew on its legs or\\r\\nwalked with its wings. The chances are that he would give it tusks and\\r\\nmake it lay eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s get Mr. Carnegie to reform the alphabet, and we’ll pray for him—if\\r\\nhe’ll take the risk. If we had adequate, competent vowels, with a system\\r\\nof accents, giving to each vowel its own soul and value, so every shade\\r\\nof that vowel would be shown in its accent, there is not a word in any\\r\\ntongue that we could not spell accurately. That would be competent,\\r\\nadequate, simplified spelling, in contrast to the clipping, the hair\\r\\npunching, the carbuncles, and the cancers which go by the name of\\r\\nsimplified spelling. If I ask you what b-o-w spells you can’t tell\\r\\nme unless you know which b-o-w I mean, and it is the same with r-o-w,\\r\\nb-o-r-e, and the whole family of words which were born out of lawful\\r\\nwedlock and don’t know their own origin.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if we had an alphabet that was adequate and competent, instead of\\r\\ninadequate and incompetent, things would be different. Spelling reform\\r\\nhas only made it bald-headed and unsightly. There is the whole tribe of\\r\\nthem, “row” and “read” and “lead”—a whole family who don’t know who they\\r\\nare. I ask you to pronounce s-o-w, and you ask me what kind of a one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we had a sane, determinate alphabet, instead of a hospital of\\r\\ncomminuted eunuchs, you would know whether one referred to the act of\\r\\na man casting the seed over the ploughed land or whether one wished to\\r\\nrecall the lady hog and the future ham.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a rotten alphabet. I appoint Mr. Carnegie to get after it, and\\r\\nleave simplified spelling alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimplified spelling brought about sun-spots, the San Francisco\\r\\nearthquake, and the recent business depression, which we would never\\r\\nhave had if spelling had been left all alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I hope I have soothed Mr. Carnegie and made him more comfortable\\r\\nthan he would have been had he received only compliment after\\r\\ncompliment, and I wish to say to him that simplified spelling is all\\r\\nright, but, like chastity, you can carry it too far.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSPELLING AND PICTURES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE ANNUAL DINNER OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, AT THE\\r\\n          WALDORF-ASTORIA, SEPTEMBER 18, 1906\\r\\n\\r\\nI am here to make an appeal to the nations in behalf of the simplified\\r\\nspelling. I have come here because they cannot all be reached except\\r\\nthrough you. There are only two forces that can carry light to all the\\r\\ncorners of the globe—only two—the sun in the heavens and the Associated\\r\\nPress down here. I may seem to be flattering the sun, but I do not mean\\r\\nit so; I am meaning only to be just and fair all around. You speak with\\r\\na million voices; no one can reach so many races, so many hearts and\\r\\nintellects, as you—except Rudyard Kipling, and he cannot do it without\\r\\nyour help. If the Associated Press will adopt and use our simplified\\r\\nforms, and thus spread them to the ends of the earth, covering the whole\\r\\nspacious planet with them as with a garden of flowers, our difficulties\\r\\nare at an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day of the three hundred and sixty-five the only pages of the\\r\\nworld’s countless newspapers that are read by all the human beings and\\r\\nangels and devils that can read, are these pages that are built out\\r\\nof Associated Press despatches. And so I beg you, I beseech you—oh,\\r\\nI implore you to spell them in our simplified forms. Do this daily,\\r\\nconstantly, persistently, for three months—only three months—it is all\\r\\nI ask. The infallible result?—victory, victory all down the line. For by\\r\\nthat time all eyes here and above and below will have become adjusted to\\r\\nthe change and in love with it, and the present clumsy and ragged forms\\r\\nwill be grotesque to the eye and revolting to the soul. And we shall\\r\\nbe rid of phthisis and phthisic and pneumonia and pneumatics, and\\r\\ndiphtheria and pterodactyl, and all those other insane words which no\\r\\nman addicted to the simple Christian life can try to spell and not lose\\r\\nsome of the bloom of his piety in the demoralizing attempt. Do not doubt\\r\\nit. We are chameleons, and our partialities and prejudices change places\\r\\nwith an easy and blessed facility, and we are soon wonted to the change\\r\\nand happy in it. We do not regret our old, yellow fangs and snags and\\r\\ntushes after we have worn nice, fresh, uniform store teeth a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo I seem to be seeking the good of the world? That is the idea. It is\\r\\nmy public attitude; privately I am merely seeking my own profit. We all\\r\\ndo it, but it is sound and it is virtuous, for no public interest\\r\\nis anything other or nobler than a massed accumulation of private\\r\\ninterests. In 1883, when the simplified-spelling movement first tried to\\r\\nmake a noise, I was indifferent to it; more—I even irreverently scoffed\\r\\nat it. What I needed was an object-lesson, you see. It is the only way\\r\\nto teach some people. Very well, I got it. At that time I was scrambling\\r\\nalong, earning the family’s bread on magazine work at seven cents a\\r\\nword, compound words at single rates, just as it is in the dark present.\\r\\nI was the property of a magazine, a seven-cent slave under a boiler-iron\\r\\ncontract. One day there came a note from the editor requiring me to\\r\\nwrite ten pages—on this revolting text: “Considerations concerning the\\r\\nalleged subterranean holophotal extemporaneousness of the conchyliaceous\\r\\nsuperimbrication of the Ornithorhyncus, as foreshadowed by the\\r\\nunintelligibility of its plesiosaurian anisodactylous aspects.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTen pages of that. Each and every word a seventeen-jointed vestibuled\\r\\nrailroad train. Seven cents a word. I saw starvation staring the family\\r\\nin the face. I went to the editor, and I took a stenographer along so\\r\\nas to have the interview down in black and white, for no magazine editor\\r\\ncan ever remember any part of a business talk except the part that’s got\\r\\ngraft in it for him and the magazine. I said, “Read that text,\\r\\nJackson, and let it go on the record; read it out loud.” He read\\r\\nit: “Considerations concerning the alleged subterranean holophotal\\r\\nextemporaneousness of the conchyliaceous superimbrication of the\\r\\nOrnithorhyncus, as foreshadowed by the unintelligibility of its\\r\\nplesiosaurian anisodactylous aspects.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI said, “You want ten pages of those rumbling, great, long, summer\\r\\nthunderpeals, and you expect to get them at seven cents a peal?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said, “A word’s a word, and seven cents is the contract; what are you\\r\\ngoing to do about it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI said, “Jackson, this is cold-blooded oppression. What’s an average\\r\\nEnglish word?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said, “Six letters.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI said, “Nothing of the kind; that’s French, and includes the spaces\\r\\nbetween the words; an average English word is four letters and a half.\\r\\nBy hard, honest labor I’ve dug all the large words out of my vocabulary\\r\\nand shaved it down till the average is three letters and a half. I can\\r\\nput one thousand and two hundred words on your page, and there’s not\\r\\nanother man alive that can come within two hundred of it. My page is\\r\\nworth eighty-four dollars to me. It takes exactly as long to fill your\\r\\nmagazine page with long words as it does with short ones-four hours.\\r\\nNow, then, look at the criminal injustice of this requirement of yours.\\r\\nI am careful, I am economical of my time and labor. For the family’s\\r\\nsake I’ve got to be so. So I never write ‘metropolis’ for seven cents,\\r\\nbecause I can get the same money for ‘city.’ I never write ‘policeman,’\\r\\nbecause I can get the same price for ‘cop.’ And so on and so on. I never\\r\\nwrite ‘valetudinarian’ at all, for not even hunger and wretchedness can\\r\\nhumble me to the point where I will do a word like that for seven cents;\\r\\nI wouldn’t do it for fifteen. Examine your obscene text, please; count\\r\\nthe words.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe counted and said it was twenty-four. I asked him to count the\\r\\nletters. He made it two hundred and three.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said, “Now, I hope you see the whole size of your crime. With my\\r\\nvocabulary I would make sixty words out of those two hundred and five\\r\\nletters, and get four dollars and twenty cents for it; whereas for your\\r\\ninhuman twenty-four I would get only one dollar and sixty-eight cents.\\r\\nTen pages of these sky-scrapers of yours would pay me only about three\\r\\nhundred dollars; in my simplified vocabulary the same space and the same\\r\\nlabor would pay me eight hundred and forty dollars. I do not wish to\\r\\nwork upon this scandalous job by the piece. I want to be hired by the\\r\\nyear.” He coldly refused. I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then for the sake of the family, if you have no feeling for me, you\\r\\nought at least to allow me overtime on that word extemporaneousness.”\\r\\n Again he coldly refused. I seldom say a harsh word to any one, but I\\r\\nwas not master of myself then, and I spoke right out and called him an\\r\\nanisodactylous plesiosaurian conchyliaceous Ornithorhyncus, and rotten\\r\\nto the heart with holoaophotal subterranean extemporaneousness. God\\r\\nforgive me for that wanton crime; he lived only two hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that day to this I have been a devoted and hard-working member\\r\\nof the heaven-born institution, the International Association for the\\r\\nPrevention of Cruelty to Authors, and now I am laboring with Carnegie’s\\r\\nSimplified Committee, and with my heart in the work....\\r\\n\\r\\nNow then, let us look at this mighty question reasonably, rationally,\\r\\nsanely—yes, and calmly, not excitedly. What is the real function, the\\r\\nessential function, the supreme function, of language? Isn’t it merely\\r\\nto convey ideas and emotions? Certainly. Then if we can do it with words\\r\\nof fonetic brevity and compactness, why keep the present cumbersome\\r\\nforms? But can we? Yes. I hold in my hand the proof of it. Here is a\\r\\nletter written by a woman, right out of her heart of hearts. I think she\\r\\nnever saw a spelling-book in her life. The spelling is her own. There\\r\\nisn’t a waste letter in it anywhere. It reduces the fonetics to the last\\r\\ngasp—it squeezes the surplusage out of every word—there’s no spelling\\r\\nthat can begin with it on this planet outside of the White House. And\\r\\nas for the punctuation, there isn’t any. It is all one sentence, eagerly\\r\\nand breathlessly uttered, without break or pause in it anywhere. The\\r\\nletter is absolutely genuine—I have the proofs of that in my possession.\\r\\nI can’t stop to spell the words for you, but you can take the letter\\r\\npresently and comfort your eyes with it. I will read the letter:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Miss dear freind I took some Close into the armerry and give them to\\r\\nyou to Send too the suffrers out to California and i Hate to treble you\\r\\nbut i got to have one of them Back it was a black oll wolle Shevyott\\r\\nWith a jacket to Mach trimed Kind of Fancy no 38 Burst measure and palsy\\r\\nmenterry acrost the front And the color i woodent Trubble you but it\\r\\nbelonged to my brothers wife and she is Mad about it i thoght she was\\r\\nwillin but she want she says she want done with it and she was going to\\r\\nWear it a Spell longer she ant so free harted as what i am and she Has\\r\\ngot more to do with Than i have having a Husband to Work and slave For\\r\\nher i gels you remember Me I am shot and stout and light complected i\\r\\ntorked with you quite a spell about the suffrars and said it was orful\\r\\nabout that erth quake I shoodent wondar if they had another one rite off\\r\\nseeine general Condision of the country is Kind of Explossive i hate to\\r\\ntake that Black dress away from the suffrars but i will hunt round And\\r\\nsee if i can get another One if i can i will call to the armerry for\\r\\nit if you will jest lay it asside so no more at present from your True\\r\\nfreind\\r\\n\\r\\n“i liked your appearance very Much”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you see what simplified spelling can do.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can convey any fact you need to convey; and it can pour out emotions\\r\\nlike a sewer. I beg you, I beseech you, to adopt our spelling, and print\\r\\nall your despatches in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I wish to say just one entirely serious word:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have reached a time of life, seventy years and a half, where none of\\r\\nthe concerns of this world have much interest for me personally. I think\\r\\nI can speak dispassionately upon this matter, because in the little\\r\\nwhile that I have got to remain here I can get along very well with\\r\\nthese old-fashioned forms, and I don’t propose to make any trouble about\\r\\nit at all. I shall soon be where they won’t care how I spell so long as\\r\\nI keep the Sabbath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are eighty-two millions of us people that use this orthography,\\r\\nand it ought to be simplified in our behalf, but it is kept in its\\r\\npresent condition to satisfy one million people who like to have their\\r\\nliterature in the old form. That looks to me to be rather selfish,\\r\\nand we keep the forms as they are while we have got one million people\\r\\ncoming in here from foreign countries every year and they have got\\r\\nto struggle with this orthography of ours, and it keeps them back\\r\\nand damages their citizenship for years until they learn to spell the\\r\\nlanguage, if they ever do learn. This is merely sentimental argument.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople say it is the spelling of Chaucer and Spencer and Shakespeare and\\r\\na lot of other people who do not know how to spell anyway, and it has\\r\\nbeen transmitted to us and we preserved it and wish to preserve it\\r\\nbecause of its ancient and hallowed associations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I don’t see that there is any real argument about that. If that\\r\\nargument is good, then it would be a good argument not to banish the\\r\\nflies and the cockroaches from hospitals because they have been there so\\r\\nlong that the patients have got used to them and they feel a tenderness\\r\\nfor them on account of the associations. Why, it is like preserving a\\r\\ncancer in a family because it is a family cancer, and we are bound to it\\r\\nby the test of affection and reverence and old, mouldy antiquity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that this declaration to improve this orthography of ours is our\\r\\nfamily cancer, and I wish we could reconcile ourselves to have it cut\\r\\nout and let the family cancer go.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, you see before you the wreck and ruin of what was once a young\\r\\nperson like yourselves. I am exhausted by the heat of the day. I must\\r\\ntake what is left of this wreck and run out of your presence and carry\\r\\nit away to my home and spread it out there and sleep the sleep of\\r\\nthe righteous. There is nothing much left of me but my age and my\\r\\nrighteousness, but I leave with you my love and my blessing, and may you\\r\\nalways keep your youth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOKS AND BURGLARS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS TO THE REDDING (CONN.) LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,\\r\\n          OCTOBER 28, 1908\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose this library had been in operation a few weeks ago, and the\\r\\nburglars who happened along and broke into my house—taking a lot of\\r\\nthings they didn’t need, and for that matter which I didn’t need—had\\r\\nfirst made entry into this institution.\\r\\n\\r\\nPicture them seated here on the floor, poring by the light of their\\r\\ndark-lanterns over some of the books they found, and thus absorbing\\r\\nmoral truths and getting a moral uplift. The whole course of their\\r\\nlives would have been changed. As it was, they kept straight on in their\\r\\nimmoral way and were sent to jail.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all we know, they may next be sent to Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, speaking of burglars, let us not speak of them too harshly. Now, I\\r\\nhave known so many burglars—not exactly known, but so many of them have\\r\\ncome near me in my various dwelling-places, that I am disposed to allow\\r\\nthem credit for whatever good qualities they possess.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief among these, and, indeed, the only one I just now think of, is\\r\\ntheir great care while doing business to avoid disturbing people’s\\r\\nsleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nNoiseless as they may be while at work, however, the effect of their\\r\\nvisitation is to murder sleep later on.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we are prepared for these visitors. All sorts of alarm devices have\\r\\nbeen put in the house, and the ground for half a mile around it has\\r\\nbeen electrified. The burglar who steps within this danger zone will\\r\\nset loose a bedlam of sounds, and spring into readiness for action our\\r\\nelaborate system of defences. As for the fate of the trespasser, do not\\r\\nseek to know that. He will never be heard of more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTHORS’ CLUB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE DINNER GIVEN IN HONOR OF MR. CLEMENS, LONDON,\\r\\n          JUNE, 1899\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens was introduced by Sir Walter Besant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does not embarrass me to hear my books praised so much. It\\r\\nonly pleases and delights me. I have not gone beyond the age when\\r\\nembarrassment is possible, but I have reached the age when I know how to\\r\\nconceal it. It is such a satisfaction to me to hear Sir Walter Besant,\\r\\nwho is much more capable than I to judge of my work, deliver a judgment\\r\\nwhich is such a contentment to my spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I have thought well of the books myself, but I think more of them\\r\\nnow. It charms me also to hear Sir Spencer Walpole deliver a similar\\r\\njudgment, and I shall treasure his remarks also. I shall not discount\\r\\nthe praises in any possible way. When I report them to my family they\\r\\nshall lose nothing. There are, however, certain heredities which come\\r\\ndown to us which our writings of the present day may be traced to. I,\\r\\nfor instance, read the Walpole Letters when I was a boy. I absorbed\\r\\nthem, gathered in their grace, wit, and humor, and put them away to be\\r\\nused by-and-by. One does that so unconsciously with things one really\\r\\nlikes. I am reminded now of what use those letters have been to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey must not claim credit in America for what was really written in\\r\\nanother form so long ago. They must only claim that I trimmed this,\\r\\nthat, and the other, and so changed their appearance as to make them\\r\\nseem to be original. You now see what modesty I have in stock. But it\\r\\nhas taken long practice to get it there.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I must not stand here talking. I merely meant to get up and give my\\r\\nthanks for the pleasant things that preceding speakers have said of me.\\r\\nI wish also to extend my thanks to the Authors’ Club for constituting me\\r\\na member, at a reasonable price per year, and for giving me the benefit\\r\\nof your legal adviser.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe you keep a lawyer. I have always kept a lawyer, too, though I\\r\\nhave never made anything out of him. It is service to an author to\\r\\nhave a lawyer. There is something so disagreeable in having a personal\\r\\ncontact with a publisher. So it is better to work through a lawyer—and\\r\\nlose your case. I understand that the publishers have been meeting\\r\\ntogether also like us. I don’t know what for, but possibly they are\\r\\ndevising new and mysterious ways for remunerating authors. I only wish\\r\\nnow to thank you for electing me a member of this club—I believe I have\\r\\npaid my dues—and to thank you again for the pleasant things you have\\r\\nsaid of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast February, when Rudyard Kipling was ill in America, the sympathy\\r\\nwhich was poured out to him was genuine and sincere, and I believe\\r\\nthat which cost Kipling so much will bring England and America closer\\r\\ntogether. I have been proud and pleased to see this growing affection\\r\\nand respect between the two countries. I hope it will continue to grow,\\r\\nand, please God, it will continue to grow. I trust we authors will leave\\r\\nto posterity, if we have nothing else to leave, a friendship between\\r\\nEngland and America that will count for much. I will now confess that I\\r\\nhave been engaged for the past eight days in compiling a publication. I\\r\\nhave brought it here to lay at your feet. I do not ask your indulgence\\r\\nin presenting it, but for your applause.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere it is: “Since England and America may be joined together in\\r\\nKipling, may they not be severed in ‘Twain.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOKSELLERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Address at banquet on Wednesday evening, May 20, 1908, of the\\r\\n          American Booksellers’ Association, which included most of the\\r\\n          leading booksellers of America, held at the rooms of the Aldine\\r\\n          Association, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis annual gathering of booksellers from all over America comes\\r\\ntogether ostensibly to eat and drink, but really to discuss business;\\r\\ntherefore I am required to talk shop. I am required to furnish a\\r\\nstatement of the indebtedness under which I lie to you gentlemen for\\r\\nyour help in enabling me to earn my living. For something over forty\\r\\nyears I have acquired my bread by print, beginning with The Innocents\\r\\nAbroad, followed at intervals of a year or so by Roughing It, Tom\\r\\nSawyer, Gilded Age, and so on. For thirty-six years my books were sold\\r\\nby subscription. You are not interested in those years, but only in the\\r\\nfour which have since followed. The books passed into the hands of my\\r\\npresent publishers at the beginning of 1900, and you then became the\\r\\nproviders of my diet. I think I may say, without flattering you, that\\r\\nyou have done exceedingly well by me. Exceedingly well is not too strong\\r\\na phrase, since the official statistics show that in four years you have\\r\\nsold twice as many volumes of my venerable books as my contract with my\\r\\npublishers bound you and them to sell in five years. To your sorrow you\\r\\nare aware that frequently, much too frequently, when a book gets to be\\r\\nfive or ten years old its annual sale shrinks to two or three hundred\\r\\ncopies, and after an added ten or twenty years ceases to sell. But you\\r\\nsell thousands of my moss-backed old books every year—the youngest of\\r\\nthem being books that range from fifteen to twenty-seven years old, and\\r\\nthe oldest reaching back to thirty-five and forty.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the terms of my contract my publishers had to account to me for\\r\\n50,000 volumes per year for five years, and pay me for them whether they\\r\\nsold them or not. It is at this point that you gentlemen come in, for\\r\\nit was your business to unload 250,000 volumes upon the public in five\\r\\nyears if you possibly could. Have you succeeded? Yes, you have—and more.\\r\\nFor in four years, with a year still to spare, you have sold the 250,000\\r\\nvolumes, and 240,000 besides.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour sales have increased each year. In the first year you sold 90,328;\\r\\nin the second year, 104,851; in the third, 133,975; in the fourth\\r\\nyear—which was last year—you sold 160,000. The aggregate for the four\\r\\nyears is 500,000 volumes, lacking 11,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the oldest book, The Innocents Abroad,—now forty years old—you\\r\\nsold upward of 46,000 copies in the four years; of Roughing It—now\\r\\nthirty-eight years old, I think—you sold 40,334; of Tom Sawyer, 41,000.\\r\\nAnd so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there is one thing that is peculiarly gratifying to me: the Personal\\r\\nRecollections of Joan of Arc is a serious book; I wrote it for love, and\\r\\nnever expected it to sell, but you have pleasantly disappointed me in\\r\\nthat matter. In your hands its sale has increased each year. In 1904 you\\r\\nsold 1726 copies; in 1905, 2445; in 1906, 5381; and last year, 6574.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“MARK TWAIN’S FIRST APPEARANCE”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          On October 5, 1906, Mr. Clemens, following a musical recital by\\r\\n          his daughter in Norfolk, Conn., addressed her audience on the\\r\\n          subject of stage-fright.  He thanked the people for making\\r\\n          things as easy as possible for his daughter’s American debut as\\r\\n          a contralto, and then told of his first experience before the\\r\\n          public.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart goes out in sympathy to any one who is making his first\\r\\nappearance before an audience of human beings. By a direct process of\\r\\nmemory I go back forty years, less one month—for I’m older than I look.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recall the occasion of my first appearance. San Francisco knew me\\r\\nthen only as a reporter, and I was to make my bow to San Francisco as\\r\\na lecturer. I knew that nothing short of compulsion would get me to the\\r\\ntheatre. So I bound myself by a hard-and-fast contract so that I could\\r\\nnot escape. I got to the theatre forty-five minutes before the hour set\\r\\nfor the lecture. My knees were shaking so that I didn’t know whether I\\r\\ncould stand up. If there is an awful, horrible malady in the world, it\\r\\nis stage-fright-and seasickness. They are a pair. I had stage-fright\\r\\nthen for the first and last time. I was only seasick once, too. It\\r\\nwas on a little ship on which there were two hundred other passengers.\\r\\nI—was—sick. I was so sick that there wasn’t any left for those other two\\r\\nhundred passengers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dark and lonely behind the scenes in that theatre, and I peeked\\r\\nthrough the little peekholes they have in theatre curtains and looked\\r\\ninto the big auditorium. That was dark and empty, too. By-and-by it\\r\\nlighted up, and the audience began to arrive.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had got a number of friends of mine, stalwart men, to sprinkle\\r\\nthemselves through the audience armed with big clubs. Every time I said\\r\\nanything they could possibly guess I intended to be funny they were to\\r\\npound those clubs on the floor. Then there was a kind lady in a box up\\r\\nthere, also a good friend of mine, the wife of the Governor. She was to\\r\\nwatch me intently, and whenever I glanced toward her she was going to\\r\\ndeliver a gubernatorial laugh that would lead the whole audience into\\r\\napplause.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I began. I had the manuscript tucked under a United States flag\\r\\nin front of me where I could get at it in case of need. But I managed to\\r\\nget started without it. I walked up and down—I was young in those days\\r\\nand needed the exercise—and talked and talked.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight in the middle of the speech I had placed a gem. I had put in a\\r\\nmoving, pathetic part which was to get at the hearts and souls of my\\r\\nhearers. When I delivered it they did just what I hoped and expected.\\r\\nThey sat silent and awed. I had touched them. Then I happened to glance\\r\\nup at the box where the Governor’s wife was—you know what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, after the first agonizing five minutes, my stage-fright left me,\\r\\nnever to return. I know if I was going to be hanged I could get up\\r\\nand make a good showing, and I intend to. But I shall never forget my\\r\\nfeelings before the agony left me, and I got up here to thank you for\\r\\nher for helping my daughter, by your kindness, to live through her\\r\\nfirst appearance. And I want to thank you for your appreciation of her\\r\\nsinging, which is, by-the-way, hereditary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMORALS AND MEMORY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens was the guest of honor at a reception held at\\r\\n          Barnard College (Columbia University), March 7, 1906, by the\\r\\n          Barnard Union.  One of the young ladies presented Mr. Clemens,\\r\\n          and thanked him for his amiability in coming to make them an\\r\\n          address.  She closed with the expression of the great joy it\\r\\n          gave her fellow-collegians, “because we all love you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIf any one here loves me, she has my sincere thanks. Nay, if any one\\r\\nhere is so good as to love me—why, I’ll be a brother to her. She shall\\r\\nhave my sincere, warm, unsullied affection. When I was coming up in the\\r\\ncar with the very kind young lady who was delegated to show me the way,\\r\\nshe asked me what I was going to talk about. And I said I wasn’t sure. I\\r\\nsaid I had some illustrations, and I was going to bring them in. I\\r\\nsaid I was certain to give those illustrations, but that I hadn’t the\\r\\nfaintest notion what they were going to illustrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I’ve been thinking it over in this forest glade [indicating the\\r\\nwoods of Arcady on the scene setting], and I’ve decided to work them in\\r\\nwith something about morals and the caprices of memory. That seems to\\r\\nme to be a pretty good subject. You see, everybody has a memory and it’s\\r\\npretty sure to have caprices. And, of course, everybody has morals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s my opinion that every one I know has morals, though I wouldn’t like\\r\\nto ask. I know I have. But I’d rather teach them than practice them any\\r\\nday. “Give them to others”—that’s my motto. Then you never have any\\r\\nuse for them when you’re left without. Now, speaking of the caprices of\\r\\nmemory in general, and of mine in particular, it’s strange to think\\r\\nof all the tricks this little mental process plays on us. Here\\r\\nwe’re endowed with a faculty of mind that ought to be more supremely\\r\\nserviceable to us than them all. And what happens? This memory of ours\\r\\nstores up a perfect record of the most useless facts and anecdotes and\\r\\nexperiences. And all the things that we ought to know—that we need\\r\\nto know—that we’d profit by knowing—it casts aside with the careless\\r\\nindifference of a girl refusing her true lover. It’s terrible to think\\r\\nof this phenomenon. I tremble in all my members when I consider all\\r\\nthe really valuable things that I’ve forgotten in seventy years—when I\\r\\nmeditate upon the caprices of my memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s a bird out in California that is one perfect symbol of the\\r\\nhuman memory. I’ve forgotten the bird’s name (just because it would be\\r\\nvaluable for me to know it—to recall it to your own minds, perhaps).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this fool of a creature goes around collecting the most ridiculous\\r\\nthings you can imagine and storing them up. He never selects a thing\\r\\nthat could ever prove of the slightest help to him; but he goes\\r\\nabout gathering iron forks, and spoons, and tin cans, and broken\\r\\nmouse-traps—all sorts of rubbish that is difficult for him to carry and\\r\\nyet be any use when he gets it. Why, that bird will go by a gold watch\\r\\nto bring back one of those patent cake-pans.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, my mind is just like that, and my mind isn’t very different from\\r\\nyours—and so our minds are just like that bird. We pass by what would be\\r\\nof inestimable value to us, and pack our memories with the most\\r\\ntrivial odds and ends that never by any chance, under any circumstances\\r\\nwhatsoever, could be of the slightest use to any one.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, things that I have remembered are constantly popping into my head.\\r\\nAnd I am repeatedly startled by the vividness with which they recur\\r\\nto me after the lapse of years and their utter uselessness in being\\r\\nremembered at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was thinking over some on my way up here. They were the illustrations\\r\\nI spoke about to the young lady on the way up. And I’ve come to the\\r\\nconclusion, curious though it is, that I can use every one of these\\r\\nfreaks of memory to teach you all a lesson. I’m convinced that each one\\r\\nhas its moral. And I think it’s my duty to hand the moral on to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I recall that when I was a boy I was a good boy—I was a very good\\r\\nboy. Why, I was the best boy in my school. I was the best boy in that\\r\\nlittle Mississippi town where I lived. The population was only about\\r\\ntwenty million. You may not believe it, but I was the best boy in that\\r\\nState—and in the United States, for that matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I don’t know why I never heard any one say that but myself. I always\\r\\nrecognized it. But even those nearest and dearest to me couldn’t seem to\\r\\nsee it. My mother, especially, seemed to think there was something wrong\\r\\nwith that estimate. And she never got over that prejudice.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when my mother got to be eighty-five years old her memory failed\\r\\nher. She forgot little threads that hold life’s patches of meaning\\r\\ntogether. She was living out West then, and I went on to visit her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hadn’t seen my mother in a year or so. And when I got there she knew\\r\\nmy face; knew I was married; knew I had a family, and that I was living\\r\\nwith them. But she couldn’t, for the life of her, tell my name or who I\\r\\nwas. So I told her I was her boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you don’t live with me,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said I, “I’m living in Rochester.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Going to school.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Large school?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very large.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All boys?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All boys.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how do you stand?” said my mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m the best boy in that school,” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said my mother, with a return of her old fire, “I’d like to know\\r\\nwhat the other boys are like.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, one point in this story is the fact that my mother’s mind went back\\r\\nto my school days, and remembered my little youthful self-prejudice when\\r\\nshe’d forgotten everything else about me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other point is the moral. There’s one there that you will find if\\r\\nyou search for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, here’s something else I remember. It’s about the first time I ever\\r\\nstole a watermelon. “Stole” is a strong word. Stole? Stole? No, I don’t\\r\\nmean that. It was the first time I ever withdrew a watermelon. It was\\r\\nthe first time I ever extracted a watermelon. That is exactly the word I\\r\\nwant—“extracted.” It is definite. It is precise. It perfectly conveys my\\r\\nidea. Its use in dentistry connotes the delicate shade of meaning I am\\r\\nlooking for. You know we never extract our own teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was not my watermelon that I extracted. I extracted that\\r\\nwatermelon from a farmer’s wagon while he was inside negotiating with\\r\\nanother customer. I carried that watermelon to one of the secluded\\r\\nrecesses of the lumber-yard, and there I broke it open.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a green watermelon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, do you know when I saw that I began to feel sorry—sorry—sorry. It\\r\\nseemed to me that I had done wrong. I reflected deeply. I reflected that\\r\\nI was young—I think I was just eleven. But I knew that though immature\\r\\nI did not lack moral advancement. I knew what a boy ought to do who had\\r\\nextracted a watermelon—like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI considered George Washington, and what action he would have taken\\r\\nunder similar circumstances. Then I knew there was just one thing to\\r\\nmake me feel right inside, and that was—Restitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I said to myself: “I will do that. I will take that green watermelon\\r\\nback where I got it from.” And the minute I had said it I felt\\r\\nthat great moral uplift that comes to you when you’ve made a noble\\r\\nresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I gathered up the biggest fragments, and I carried them back to the\\r\\nfarmer’s wagon, and I restored the watermelon—what was left of it. And I\\r\\nmade him give me a good one in place of it, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself going around working\\r\\noff his worthless, old, green watermelons on trusting purchasers who had\\r\\nto rely on him. How could they tell from the outside whether the melons\\r\\nwere good or not? That was his business. And if he didn’t reform, I told\\r\\nhim I’d see that he didn’t get any more of my trade—nor anybody else’s I\\r\\nknew, if I could help it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know that man was as contrite as a revivalist’s last convert. He\\r\\nsaid he was all broken up to think I’d gotten a green watermelon.\\r\\nHe promised that he would never carry another green watermelon if he\\r\\nstarved for it. And he drove off—a better man.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, do you see what I did for that man? He was on a downward path, and\\r\\nI rescued him. But all I got out of it was a watermelon.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet I’d rather have that memory—just that memory of the good I did for\\r\\nthat depraved farmer—than all the material gain you can think of. Look\\r\\nat the lesson he got! I never got anything like that from it. But\\r\\nI ought to be satisfied: I was only eleven years old, but I secured\\r\\neverlasting benefit to other people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moral in this is perfectly clear, and I think there’s one in the\\r\\nnext memory I’m going to tell you about.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo go back to my childhood, there’s another little incident that comes\\r\\nto me from which you can draw even another moral. It’s about one of the\\r\\ntimes I went fishing. You see, in our house there was a sort of family\\r\\nprejudice against going fishing if you hadn’t permission. But it would\\r\\nfrequently be bad judgment to ask. So I went fishing secretly, as it\\r\\nwere—way up the Mississippi. It was an exquisitely happy trip, I recall,\\r\\nwith a very pleasant sensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, while I was away there was a tragedy in our town. A stranger,\\r\\nstopping over on his way East from California; was stabbed to death in\\r\\nan unseemly brawl.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, my father was justice of the peace, and because he was justice\\r\\nof the peace he was coroner; and since he was coroner he was also\\r\\nconstable; and being constable he was sheriff; and out of consideration\\r\\nfor his holding the office of sheriff he was likewise county clerk and a\\r\\ndozen other officials I don’t think of just this minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought he had power of life or death, only he didn’t use it over\\r\\nother boys. He was sort of an austere man. Somehow I didn’t like being\\r\\nround him when I’d done anything he disapproved of. So that’s the reason\\r\\nI wasn’t often around.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, when this gentleman got knifed they communicated with the proper\\r\\nauthority, the coroner, and they laid the corpse out in the coroner’s\\r\\noffice—our front sitting-room—in preparation for the inquest the next\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 9 or 10 o’clock I got back from fishing. It was a little too late\\r\\nfor me to be received by my folks, so I took my shoes off and slipped\\r\\nnoiselessly up the back way to the sitting-room. I was very tired, and I\\r\\ndidn’t wish to disturb my people. So I groped my way to the sofa and lay\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I didn’t know anything of what had happened during my absence.\\r\\nBut I was sort of nervous on my own account-afraid of being caught, and\\r\\nrather dubious about the morning affair. And I had been lying there\\r\\na few moments when my eyes gradually got used to the darkness, and I\\r\\nbecame aware of something on the other side of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was something foreign to the apartment. It had an uncanny appearance.\\r\\nAnd I sat up looking very hard, and wondering what in heaven this long,\\r\\nformless, vicious-looking thing might be.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst I thought I’d go and see. Then I thought, “Never mind that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMind you, I had no cowardly sensations whatever, but it didn’t seem\\r\\nexactly prudent to investigate. But I somehow couldn’t keep my eyes off\\r\\nthe thing. And the more I looked at it the more disagreeably it grew on\\r\\nme. But I was resolved to play the man. So I decided to turn over and\\r\\ncount a hundred, and let the patch of moonlight creep up and show me\\r\\nwhat the dickens it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned over and tried to count, but I couldn’t keep my mind on it. I\\r\\nkept thinking of that grewsome mass. I was losing count all the time,\\r\\nand going back and beginning over again. Oh no; I wasn’t frightened—just\\r\\nannoyed. But by the time I’d gotten to the century mark I turned\\r\\ncautiously over and opened my eyes with great fortitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moonlight revealed to me a marble-white human hand. Well, maybe I\\r\\nwasn’t embarrassed! But then that changed to a creepy feeling again,\\r\\nand I thought I’d try the counting again. I don’t know how many hours or\\r\\nweeks it was that I lay there counting hard. But the moonlight crept up\\r\\nthat white arm, and it showed me a lead face and a terrible wound over\\r\\nthe heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could scarcely say that I was terror-stricken or anything like that.\\r\\nBut somehow his eyes interested me so that I went right out of the\\r\\nwindow. I didn’t need the sash. But it seemed easier to take it than\\r\\nleave it behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let that teach you a lesson—I don’t know just what it is. But at\\r\\nseventy years old I find that memory of peculiar value to me. I have\\r\\nbeen unconsciously guided by it all these years. Things that seemed\\r\\npigeon-holed and remote are a perpetual influence. Yes, you’re taught in\\r\\nso many ways. And you’re so felicitously taught when you don’t know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s something else that taught me a good deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was seventeen I was very bashful, and a sixteen-year-old girl\\r\\ncame to stay a week with us. She was a peach, and I was seized with a\\r\\nhappiness not of this world.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening my mother suggested that, to entertain her, I take her\\r\\nto the theatre. I didn’t really like to, because I was seventeen and\\r\\nsensitive about appearing in the streets with a girl. I couldn’t see my\\r\\nway to enjoying my delight in public. But we went.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t feel very happy. I couldn’t seem to keep my mind on the play.\\r\\nI became conscious, after a while, that that was due less to my lovely\\r\\ncompany than my boots. They were sweet to look upon, as smooth as skin,\\r\\nbut fitted ten time as close. I got oblivious to the play and the girl\\r\\nand the other people and everything but my boots until—I hitched one\\r\\npartly off. The sensation was sensuously perfect: I couldn’t help it.\\r\\nI had to get the other off, partly. Then I was obliged to get them off\\r\\naltogether, except that I kept my feet in the legs so they couldn’t get\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that time I enjoyed the play. But the first thing I knew the\\r\\ncurtain came down, like that, without my notice, and—I hadn’t any boots\\r\\non. What’s more, they wouldn’t go on. I tugged strenuously. And the\\r\\npeople in our row got up and fussed and said things until the peach and\\r\\nI simply had to move on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved—the girl on one arm and the boots under the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walked home that way, sixteen blocks, with a retinue a mile long:\\r\\nEvery time we passed a lamp-post, death gripped me at the throat. But we\\r\\ngot home—and I had on white socks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I live to be nine hundred and ninety-nine years old I don’t suppose\\r\\nI could ever forget that walk. I remember, it about as keenly as the\\r\\nchagrin I suffered on another occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one time in our domestic history we had a colored butler who had a\\r\\nfailing. He could never remember to ask people who came to the door\\r\\nto state their business. So I used to suffer a good many calls\\r\\nunnecessarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning when I was especially busy he brought me a card engraved\\r\\nwith a name I did not know. So I said, “What does he wish to see\\r\\nme for?” and Sylvester said, “Ah couldn’t ask him, sah; he, wuz a\\r\\ngenlinun.” “Return instantly,” I thundered, “and inquire his mission.\\r\\nAsk him what’s his game.” Well, Sylvester returned with the announcement\\r\\nthat he had lightning-rods to sell. “Indeed,” said I, “things are coming\\r\\nto a fine pass when lightning-rod agents send up engraved cards.” “He\\r\\nhas pictures,” added Sylvester. “Pictures, indeed! He maybe peddling\\r\\netchings. Has he a Russia leather case?” But Sylvester was too\\r\\nfrightened to remember. I said; “I am going down to make it hot for that\\r\\nupstart!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI went down the stairs, working up my temper all the way. When I got to\\r\\nthe parlor I was in a fine frenzy concealed beneath a veneer of frigid\\r\\ncourtesy. And when I looked in the door, sure enough he had a Russia\\r\\nleather case in his hand. But I didn’t happen to notice that it was our\\r\\nRussia leather case.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if you’d believe me, that man was sitting with a whole gallery of\\r\\netchings spread out before him. But I didn’t happen to notice that\\r\\nthey were our etchings, spread out by some member of my family for some\\r\\nunguessed purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery curtly I asked the gentleman his business. With a surprised, timid\\r\\nmanner he faltered that he had met my wife and daughter at Onteora, and\\r\\nthey had asked him to call. Fine lie, I thought, and I froze him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to be kind of non-plussed, and sat there fingering the\\r\\netchings in the case until I told him he needn’t bother, because we had\\r\\nthose. That pleased him so much that he leaned over, in an embarrassed\\r\\nway, to pick up another from the floor. But I stopped him. I\\r\\nsaid, “We’ve got that, too.” He seemed pitifully amazed, but I was\\r\\ncongratulating myself on my great success.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally the gentleman asked where Mr. Winton lived; he’d met him in the\\r\\nmountains, too. So I said I’d show him gladly. And I did on the spot.\\r\\nAnd when he was gone I felt queer, because there were all his etchings\\r\\nspread out on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, my wife came in and asked me who had been in. I showed her the\\r\\ncard, and told her all exultantly. To my dismay she nearly fainted. She\\r\\ntold me he had been a most kind friend to them in the country, and had\\r\\nforgotten to tell me that he was expected our way. And she pushed me out\\r\\nof the door, and commanded me to get over to the Wintons in a hurry and\\r\\nget him back.\\r\\n\\r\\nI came into the drawing-room, where Mrs. Winton was sitting up very\\r\\nstiff in a chair, beating me at my own game. Well, I began to put\\r\\nanother light on things. Before many seconds Mrs. Winton saw it was\\r\\ntime to change her temperature. In five minutes I had asked the man to\\r\\nluncheon, and she to dinner, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made that fellow change his trip and stay a week, and we gave him the\\r\\ntime of his life. Why, I don’t believe we let him get sober the whole\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nI trust that you will carry away some good thought from these lessons I\\r\\nhave given you, and that the memory of them will inspire you to higher\\r\\nthings, and elevate you to plans far above the old—and—and—\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I tell you one thing, young ladies: I’ve had a better time with you\\r\\nto-day than with that peach fifty-three years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQUEEN VICTORIA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS TO THE BRITISH SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES CLUB, AT\\r\\n          DELMONICO’S, MONDAY, MAY 25, 1908, IN HONOR OF QUEEN VICTORIA’S\\r\\n          BIRTHDAY\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens told the story of his duel with a rival editor: how\\r\\n          he practised firing at a barn door and failed to hit it, but a\\r\\n          friend of his took off the head of a little bird at thirty-five\\r\\n          yards and attributed the shot to Mark twain.  The duel did not\\r\\n          take place.  Mr. Clemens continued as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also happened that I was the means of stopping duelling in Nevada,\\r\\nfor a law was passed sending all duellists to jail for two years, and\\r\\nthe Governor, hearing of my marksmanship, said that if he got me I\\r\\nshould go to prison for the full term. That’s why I left Nevada, and I\\r\\nhave not been there since.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou do me a high honor, indeed, in selecting me to speak of my country\\r\\nin this commemoration of the birthday of that noble lady whose life was\\r\\nconsecrated to the virtues and the humanities and to the promotion of\\r\\nlofty ideals, and was a model upon which many a humbler life was formed\\r\\nand made beautiful while she lived, and upon which many such lives will\\r\\nstill be formed in the generations that are to come—a life which finds\\r\\nits just image in the star which falls out of its place in the sky and\\r\\nout of existence, but whose light still streams with unfaded lustre\\r\\nacross the abysses of space long after its fires have been extinguished\\r\\nat their source.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a woman the Queen was all that the most exacting standards could\\r\\nrequire. As a far-reaching and effective beneficent moral force she had\\r\\nno peer in her time among either, monarchs or commoners. As a monarch\\r\\nshe was without reproach in her great office. We may not venture,\\r\\nperhaps, to say so sweeping a thing as this in cold blood about any\\r\\nmonarch that preceded her upon either her own throne or upon any other.\\r\\nIt is a colossal eulogy, but it is justified.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn those qualities of the heart which beget affection in all sorts and\\r\\nconditions of men she was rich, surprisingly rich, and for this she will\\r\\nstill be remembered and revered in the far-off ages when the political\\r\\nglories of her reign shall have faded from vital history and fallen to\\r\\na place in that scrap-heap of unverifiable odds and ends which we call\\r\\ntradition. Which is to say, in briefer phrase, that her name will live\\r\\nalways. And with it her character—a fame rare in the history of thrones,\\r\\ndominions, principalities, and powers, since it will not rest upon\\r\\nharvested selfish and sordid ambitions, but upon love, earned and freely\\r\\nvouchsafed. She mended broken hearts where she could, but she broke\\r\\nnone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat she did for us in America in our time of storm and stress we shall\\r\\nnot forget, and whenever we call it to mind we shall always remember\\r\\nthe wise and righteous mind that guided her in it and sustained and\\r\\nsupported her—Prince Albert’s. We need not talk any idle talk here\\r\\nto-night about either possible or impossible war between the two\\r\\ncountries; there will be no war while we remain sane and the son of\\r\\nVictoria and Albert sits upon the throne. In conclusion, I believe I may\\r\\njustly claim to utter the voice of my country in saying that we hold him\\r\\nin deep honor, and also in cordially wishing him a long life and a happy\\r\\nreign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJOAN OF ARC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE DINNER OF THE SOCIETY OF ILLUSTRATORS, GIVEN AT\\r\\n          THE ALDINE ASSOCIATION CLUB, DECEMBER 22, 1905\\r\\n\\r\\n          Just before Mr. Clemens made his speech, a young woman attired\\r\\n          as Joan of Arc, with a page bearing her flag of battle,\\r\\n          courtesied reverently and tendered Mr. Clemens a laurel wreath\\r\\n          on a satin pillow.  He tried to speak, but his voice failed\\r\\n          from excess of emotion. “I thank you!” he finally exclaimed,\\r\\n          and, pulling himself together, he began his speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there is an illustration [pointing to the retreating Joan of\\r\\nArc]. That is exactly what I wanted—precisely what I wanted—when I was\\r\\ndescribing to myself Joan of Arc, after studying her history and her\\r\\ncharacter for twelve years diligently.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the product—not the conventional Joan of Arc. Wherever you find\\r\\nthe conventional Joan of Arc in history she is an offence to anybody who\\r\\nknows the story of that wonderful girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, she was—she was almost supreme in several details. She had a\\r\\nmarvellous intellect; she had a great heart, had a noble spirit, was\\r\\nabsolutely pure in her character, her feeling, her language, her words,\\r\\nher everything—she was only eighteen years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow put that heart into such a breast—eighteen years old—and give it\\r\\nthat masterly intellect which showed in the face, and furnish it\\r\\nwith that almost god-like spirit, and what are you going to have? The\\r\\nconventional Joan of Arc? Not by any means. That is impossible. I cannot\\r\\ncomprehend any such thing as that.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must have a creature like that young and fair and beautiful girl we\\r\\njust saw. And her spirit must look out of the eyes. The figure should\\r\\nbe—the figure should be in harmony with all that, but, oh, what we get\\r\\nin the conventional picture, and it is always the conventional picture!\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you will allow me to say that your guild, when you take the\\r\\nconventional, you have got it at second-hand. Certainly, if you had\\r\\nstudied and studied, then you might have something else as a result, but\\r\\nwhen you have the common convention you stick to that.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou cannot prevail upon the artist to do it; he always gives you a Joan\\r\\nof Arc—that lovely creature that started a great career at thirteen, but\\r\\nwhose greatness arrived when she was eighteen; and merely because\\r\\nshe was a girl he can not see the divinity in her, and so he paints a\\r\\npeasant, a coarse and lubberly figure—the figure of a cotton-bale, and\\r\\nhe clothes that in the coarsest raiment of the peasant region just like\\r\\na fish woman, her hair cropped short like a Russian peasant, and that\\r\\nface of hers, which should be beautiful and which should radiate all the\\r\\nglories which are in the spirit and in her heart that expression in that\\r\\nface is always just the fixed expression of a ham.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now Mr. Beard has intimated a moment ago, and so has Sir\\r\\nPurdon-Clarke also, that the artist, the illustrator, does not often\\r\\nget the idea of the man whose book he is illustrating. Here is a very\\r\\nremarkable instance of the other thing in Mr. Beard, who illustrated a\\r\\nbook of mine. You may never have heard of it. I will tell you about it\\r\\nnow—A Yankee in King Arthur’s Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Beard got everything that I put into that book and a little more\\r\\nbesides. Those pictures of Beard’s in that book—oh, from the first\\r\\npage to the last is one vast sardonic laugh at the trivialities, the\\r\\nservilities of our poor human race, and also at the professions and\\r\\nthe insolence of priest-craft and king-craft—those creatures that make\\r\\nslaves of themselves and have not the manliness to shake it off. Beard\\r\\nput it all in that book. I meant it to be there. I put a lot of it there\\r\\nand Beard put the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat publisher of mine in Hartford had an eye for the pennies, and he\\r\\nsaved them. He did not waste any on the illustrations. He had a very\\r\\ngood artist—Williams—who had never taken a lesson in drawing. Everything\\r\\nhe did was original. The publisher hired the cheapest wood-engraver he\\r\\ncould find, and in my early books you can see a trace of that. You can\\r\\nsee that if Williams had had a chance he would have made some very good\\r\\npictures. He had a good heart and good intentions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a character in the first book he illustrated—The Innocents Abroad.\\r\\nThat was a boy seventeen or eighteen years old—Jack Van Nostrand—a New\\r\\nYork boy, who, to my mind, was a very remarkable creature. He and I\\r\\ntried to get Williams to understand that boy, and make a picture of Jack\\r\\nthat would be worthy of Jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nJack was a most singular combination. He was born and reared in New York\\r\\nhere. He was as delicate in his feelings, as clean and pure and refined\\r\\nin his feelings as any lovely girl that ever was, but whenever he\\r\\nexpressed a feeling he did it in Bowery slang, and it was a most curious\\r\\ncombination—that delicacy of his and that apparent coarseness. There\\r\\nwas no coarseness inside of Jack at all, and Jack, in the course of\\r\\nseventeen or eighteen years, had acquired a capital of ignorance that\\r\\nwas marvellous—ignorance of various things, not of all things. For\\r\\ninstance, he did not know anything about the Bible. He had never been\\r\\nin Sunday-school. Jack got more out of the Holy Land than anybody else,\\r\\nbecause the others knew what they were expecting, but it was a land of\\r\\nsurprises to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said in the book that we found him watching a turtle on a log, stoning\\r\\nthat turtle, and he was stoning that turtle because he had read that\\r\\n“The song of the turtle was heard in the land,” and this turtle wouldn’t\\r\\nsing. It sounded absurd, but it was charged on Jack as a fact, and as\\r\\nhe went along through that country he had a proper foil in an old\\r\\nrebel colonel, who was superintendent and head engineer in a large\\r\\nSunday-school in Wheeling, West Virginia. That man was full of\\r\\nenthusiasm wherever he went, and would stand and deliver himself of\\r\\nspeeches, and Jack would listen to those speeches of the colonel and\\r\\nwonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nJack had made a trip as a child almost across this continent in the\\r\\nfirst overland stage-coach. That man’s name who ran that line of\\r\\nstages—well, I declare that name is gone. Well, names will go.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalliday—ah, that’s the name—Ben Halliday, your uncle [turning to\\r\\nMr. Carnegie]. That was the fellow—Ben Halliday—and Jack was full of\\r\\nadmiration at the prodigious speed that that line of stages made—and it\\r\\nwas good speed—one hundred and twenty-five miles a day, going day and\\r\\nnight, and it was the event of Jack’s life, and there at the Fords of\\r\\nthe Jordan the colonel was inspired to a speech (he was always making a\\r\\nspeech), so he called us up to him. He called up five sinners and three\\r\\nsaints. It has been only lately that Mr. Carnegie beatified me. And he\\r\\nsaid: “Here are the Fords of the Jordan—a monumental place. At this very\\r\\npoint, when Moses brought the children of Israel through—he brought\\r\\nthe children of Israel from Egypt through the desert you see there—he\\r\\nguarded them through that desert patiently, patiently during forty\\r\\nyears, and brought them to this spot safe and sound. There you see—there\\r\\nis the scene of what Moses did.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Jack said: “Moses who?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” he says, “Jack, you ought not to ask that! Moses, the great\\r\\nlaw-giver! Moses, the great patriot! Moses, the great warrior! Moses,\\r\\nthe great guide, who, as I tell you, brought these people through these\\r\\nthree hundred miles of sand in forty years, and landed them safe and\\r\\nsound.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJack said: “There’s nothin’ in that three hundred miles in forty years.\\r\\nBen Halliday would have snaked ‘em through in thirty—six hours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I was speaking of Jack’s innocence, and it was beautiful. Jack was\\r\\nnot ignorant on all subjects. That boy was a deep student in the history\\r\\nof Anglo-Saxon liberty, and he was a patriot all the way through to\\r\\nthe marrow. There was a subject that interested him all the time.\\r\\nOther subjects were of no concern to Jack, but that quaint, inscrutable\\r\\ninnocence of his I could not get Williams to put into the picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, Williams wanted to do it. He said: “I will make him as innocent\\r\\nas a virgin.” He thought a moment, and then said, “I will make him as\\r\\ninnocent as an unborn virgin;” which covered the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was reminded of Jack because I came across a letter to-day which is\\r\\nover thirty years old that Jack wrote. Jack was doomed to consumption.\\r\\nHe was very long and slim, poor creature; and in a year or two after\\r\\nhe got back from that excursion, to the Holy Land he went on a ride on\\r\\nhorseback through Colorado, and he did not last but a year or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wrote this letter, not to me, but to a friend of mine; and he said:\\r\\n“I have ridden horseback”——this was three years after—“I have ridden\\r\\nhorseback four hundred miles through a desert country where you\\r\\nnever see anything but cattle now and then, and now and then a cattle\\r\\nstation—ten miles apart, twenty miles apart. Now you tell Clemens that\\r\\nin all that stretch of four hundred miles I have seen only two books—the\\r\\nBible and ‘Innocents Abroad’. Tell Clemens the Bible was in a very good\\r\\ncondition.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI say that he had studied, and he had, the real Saxon liberty, the\\r\\nacquirement of our liberty, and Jack used to repeat some verses—I don’t\\r\\nknow where they came from, but I thought of them to-day when I saw that\\r\\nletter—that that boy could have been talking of himself in those quoted\\r\\nlines from that unknown poet:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n               “For he had sat at Sidney’s feet\\r\\n               And walked with him in plain apart,\\r\\n               And through the centuries heard the beat\\r\\n               Of Freedom’s march through Cromwell’s heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he was that kind of a boy. He should have lived, and yet he should\\r\\nnot have lived, because he died at that early age—he couldn’t have been\\r\\nmore than twenty—he had seen all there was to see in the world that was\\r\\nworth the trouble of living in it; he had seen all of this world that is\\r\\nvaluable; he had seen all of this world that was illusion, and illusion,\\r\\nis the only valuable thing in it. He had arrived at that point where\\r\\npresently the illusions would cease and he would have entered upon the\\r\\nrealities of life, and God help the man that has arrived at that point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACCIDENT INSURANCE—ETC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          DELIVERED IN HARTFORD, AT A DINNER TO CORNELIUS WALFORD,\\r\\n          OF LONDON\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMEN,—I am glad, indeed, to assist in welcoming the distinguished\\r\\nguest of this occasion to a city whose fame as an insurance centre has\\r\\nextended to all lands, and given us the name of being a quadruple band\\r\\nof brothers working sweetly hand in hand—the Colt’s arms company making\\r\\nthe destruction of our race easy and convenient, our life-insurance\\r\\ncitizens paying for the victims when they pass away, Mr. Batterson\\r\\nperpetuating their memory with his stately monuments, and our\\r\\nfire-insurance comrades taking care of their hereafter. I am glad to\\r\\nassist in welcoming our guest—first, because he is an Englishman, and I\\r\\nowe a heavy debt of hospitality to certain of his fellow-countrymen;\\r\\nand secondly, because he is in sympathy with insurance, and has been\\r\\nthe means of making many other men cast their sympathies in the same\\r\\ndirection.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly there is no nobler field for human effort than the insurance\\r\\nline of business—especially accident insurance. Ever since I have been a\\r\\ndirector in an accident-insurance company I have felt that I am a better\\r\\nman. Life has seemed more precious. Accidents have assumed a kindlier\\r\\naspect. Distressing special providences have lost half their horror. I\\r\\nlook upon a cripple now with affectionate interest—as an advertisement.\\r\\nI do not seem to care for poetry any more. I do not care for\\r\\npolitics—even agriculture does not excite me. But to me now there is a\\r\\ncharm about a railway collision that is unspeakable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing more beneficent than accident insurance. I have seen\\r\\nan entire family lifted out of poverty and into affluence by the simple\\r\\nboon of a broken leg. I have had people come to me on crutches, with\\r\\ntears in their eyes, to bless this beneficent institution. In all my\\r\\nexperience of life, I have seen nothing so seraphic as the look that\\r\\ncomes into a freshly mutilated man’s face when he feels in his vest\\r\\npocket with his remaining hand and finds his accident ticket all right.\\r\\nAnd I have seen nothing so sad as the look that came into another\\r\\nsplintered customer’s face when he found he couldn’t collect on a wooden\\r\\nleg.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will remark here, by way of advertisement, that that noble charity\\r\\nwhich we have named the HARTFORD ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANY is an\\r\\ninstitution, which is peculiarly to be depended upon. A man is bound to\\r\\nprosper who gives it his custom. No man can take out a policy in it and\\r\\nnot get crippled before the year is out. Now there was one indigent\\r\\nman who had been disappointed so often with other companies that he had\\r\\ngrown disheartened, his appetite left him, he ceased to smile—said life\\r\\nwas but a weariness. Three weeks ago I got him to insure with us, and\\r\\nnow he is the brightest, happiest spirit in this land—has a good steady\\r\\nincome and a stylish suit of new bandages every day, and travels around\\r\\non a shutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say in conclusion, that my share of the welcome to our guest is\\r\\nnone the less hearty because I talk so much nonsense, and I know that I\\r\\ncan say the same far the rest of the speakers.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The speaker was a director of the company named.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOSTEOPATHY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          On February 27, 1901, Mr. Clemens appeared before the Assembly\\r\\n          Committee in Albany, New York, in favor of the Seymour bill\\r\\n          legalizing the practice of osteopathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN,—Dr. Van Fleet is the gentleman who gave\\r\\nme the character. I have heard my character discussed a thousand times\\r\\nbefore you were born, sir, and shown the iniquities in it, and you did\\r\\nnot get more than half of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was touched and distressed when they brought that part of a child in\\r\\nhere, and proved that you cannot take a child to pieces in that way.\\r\\nWhat remarkable names those diseases have! It makes me envious of the\\r\\nman that has them all. I have had many diseases, and am thankful for all\\r\\nI have had.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the gentlemen spoke of the knowledge of something else found in\\r\\nSweden, a treatment which I took. It is, I suppose, a kindred thing.\\r\\nThere is apparently no great difference between them. I was a year and\\r\\na half in London and Sweden, in the hands of that grand old man, Mr.\\r\\nKildren.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot call him a doctor, for he has not the authority to give a\\r\\ncertificate if a patient should die, but fortunately they don’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe State stands as a mighty Gibraltar clothed with power. It stands\\r\\nbetween me and my body, and tells me what kind of a doctor I must\\r\\nemploy. When my soul is sick unlimited spiritual liberty is given me by\\r\\nthe State. Now then, it doesn’t seem logical that the State shall depart\\r\\nfrom this great policy, the health of the soul, and change about and\\r\\ntake the other position in the matter of smaller consequence—the health\\r\\nof the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bell bill limitations would drive the osteopaths out of the State.\\r\\nOh, dear me! when you drive somebody out of the State you create the\\r\\nsame condition as prevailed in the Garden of Eden.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou want the thing that you can’t have. I didn’t care much about the\\r\\nosteopaths, but as soon as I found they were going to drive them out I\\r\\ngot in a state of uneasiness, and I can’t sleep nights now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know how Adam felt in the Garden of Eden about the prohibited apple.\\r\\nAdam didn’t want the apple till he found out he couldn’t have it, just\\r\\nas he would have wanted osteopathy if he couldn’t have it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhose property is my body? Probably mine. I so regard it. If I\\r\\nexperiment with it, who must be answerable? I, not the State. If I\\r\\nchoose injudiciously, does the State die? Oh no.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was the subject of my mother’s experiment. She was wise. She made\\r\\nexperiments cautiously. She didn’t pick out just any child in the\\r\\nflock. No, she chose judiciously. She chose one she could spare, and she\\r\\ncouldn’t spare the others. I was the choice child of the flock; so I had\\r\\nto take all of the experiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1844 Kneipp filled the world with the wonder of the water cure.\\r\\nMother wanted to try it, but on sober second thought she put me through.\\r\\nA bucket of ice-water was poured over to see the effect. Then I was\\r\\nrubbed down with flannels, sheet was dipped in the water, and I was put\\r\\nto bed. I perspired so much that mother put a life-preserver to bed with\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this had nothing but a spiritual effect on me, and I didn’t care for\\r\\nthat. When they took off the sheet it was yellow from the output of my\\r\\nconscience, the exudation of sin. It purified me spiritually, and it\\r\\nremains until this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have experimented with osteopathy and allopathy. I took a chance at\\r\\nthe latter for old times’ sake, for, three times, when a boy, mother’s\\r\\nnew methods got me so near death’s door she had to call in the family\\r\\nphysician to pull me out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe physicians think they are moved by regard for the best interests of\\r\\nthe public. Isn’t there a little touch of self-interest back of it all?\\r\\nIt seems to me there is, and I don’t claim to have all the virtues—only\\r\\nnine or ten of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born in the “Banner State,” and by “Banner State” I mean Missouri.\\r\\nOsteopathy was born in the same State, and both of us are getting along\\r\\nreasonably well. At a time during my younger days my attention was\\r\\nattracted to a picture of a house which bore the inscription, “Christ\\r\\nDisputing with the Doctors.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could attach no other meaning to it than that Christ was actually\\r\\nquarreling with the doctors. So I asked an old slave, who was a sort of\\r\\na herb doctor in a small way—unlicensed, of course—what the meaning\\r\\nof the picture was. “What had he done?” I asked. And the colored man\\r\\nreplied “Humph, he ain’t got no license.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWATER-SUPPLY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens visited Albany on February 27 and 28, 1901. The\\r\\n          privileges of the floor were granted to him and he was asked to make a\\r\\n          short address to the Senate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,—I do not know how to thank you sufficiently\\r\\nfor this high honor which you are conferring upon me. I have for the\\r\\nsecond time now enjoyed this kind of prodigal hospitality—in the other\\r\\nHouse yesterday, to-day in this one. I am a modest man, and diffident\\r\\nabout appearing before legislative bodies, and yet utterly and entirely\\r\\nappreciative of a courtesy like this when it is extended to me, and I\\r\\nthank you very much for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had the privilege, which unfortunately I have not got, of\\r\\nsuggesting things to the legislators in my individual capacity, I would\\r\\nso enjoy the opportunity that I would not charge anything for it at all.\\r\\nI would do that without a salary. I would give them the benefit of my\\r\\nwisdom and experience in legislative bodies, and if I could have had the\\r\\nprivilege for a few minutes of giving advice to the other House I should\\r\\nhave liked to, but of course I could not undertake it, as they did not\\r\\nask me to do it—but if they had only asked me!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that the House is considering a measure which is to furnish a\\r\\nwater-supply to the city of New York, why, permit me to say I live\\r\\nin New York myself. I know all about its ways, its desires, and its\\r\\nresidents, and—if I had the privilege—I should have urged them not to\\r\\nweary themselves over a measure like that to furnish water to the city\\r\\nof New York, for we never drink it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I will not venture to advise this body, as I only venture to advise\\r\\nbodies who are, not present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMISTAKEN IDENTITY\\r\\n\\r\\nADDRESS AT THE ANNUAL “LADIES’ DAY,” PAPYRUS CLUB, BOSTON\\r\\n\\r\\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN,—I am perfectly\\r\\nastonished—a-s-t-o-n-i-s-h-e-d—ladies and gentlemen—astonished at\\r\\nthe way history repeats itself. I find myself situated at this moment\\r\\nexactly and precisely as I was once before, years ago, to a jot, to a\\r\\ntittle—to a very hair. There isn’t a shade of difference. It is the most\\r\\nastonishing coincidence that ever—but wait. I will tell you the former\\r\\ninstance, and then you will see it for yourself. Years ago I arrived one\\r\\nday at Salamanca, New York, eastward bound; must change cars there and\\r\\ntake the sleeper train. There were crowds of people there, and they were\\r\\nswarming into the long sleeper train and packing it full, and it was a\\r\\nperfect purgatory of dust and confusion and gritting of teeth and soft,\\r\\nsweet, and low profanity. I asked the young man in the ticket-office if\\r\\nI could have a sleeping-section, and he answered “No,” with a snarl that\\r\\nshrivelled me up like burned leather. I went off, smarting under this\\r\\ninsult to my dignity, and asked another local official, supplicatingly,\\r\\nif I couldn’t have some poor little corner somewhere in a sleeping-car;\\r\\nbut he cut me short with a venomous “No, you can’t; every corner is\\r\\nfull. Now, don’t bother me any more”; and he turned his back and walked\\r\\noff. My dignity was in a state now which cannot be described. I was so\\r\\nruffled that—“well,” I said to my companion, “If these people knew who\\r\\nI am they—” But my companion cut me short there—“Don’t talk such folly,”\\r\\n he said; “if they did know who you are, do you suppose it would help\\r\\nyour high-mightiness to a vacancy in a train which has no vacancies in\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis did not improve my condition any to speak of, but just then I\\r\\nobserved that the colored porter of a sleeping-car had his eye on me.\\r\\nI saw his dark countenance light up. He whispered to the uniformed\\r\\nconductor, punctuating with nods and jerks toward me, and straightway\\r\\nthis conductor came forward, oozing politeness from every pore.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can I be of any service to you?” he asked. “Will you have a place in\\r\\nthe sleeper?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” I said, “and much oblige me, too. Give me anything—anything will\\r\\nanswer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have nothing left but the big family state-room,” he continued,\\r\\n“with two berths and a couple of arm-chairs in it, but it is entirely at\\r\\nyour disposal. Here, Tom, take these satchels aboard!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he touched his hat and we and the colored Tom moved along. I was\\r\\nbursting to drop just one little remark to my companion, but I held in\\r\\nand waited. Tom made us comfortable in that sumptuous great apartment,\\r\\nand then said, with many bows and a perfect affluence of smiles:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, is dey anything you want, sah? Case you kin have jes’ anything you\\r\\nwants. It don’t make no difference what it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can I have some hot water and a tumbler at nine to-night-blazing hot?”\\r\\n I asked. “You know about the right temperature for a hot Scotch punch?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sah, dat you kin; you kin pen on it; I’ll get it myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good! Now, that lamp is hung too high. Can I have a big coach candle\\r\\nfixed up just at the head of my bed, so that I can read comfortably?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sah, you kin; I’ll fix her up myself, an’ I’ll fix her so she’ll\\r\\nburn all night. Yes, sah; an’ you can jes’ call for anything you want,\\r\\nand dish yer whole railroad’ll be turned wrong end up an’ inside out for\\r\\nto get it for you. Dat’s so.” And he disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I tilted my head back, hooked my thumbs in my armholes, smiled a\\r\\nsmile on my companion, and said, gently:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what do you say now?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion was not in the humor to respond, and didn’t. The next\\r\\nmoment that smiling black face was thrust in at the crack of the door,\\r\\nand this speech followed:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Laws bless you, sah, I knowed you in a minute. I told de conductah so.\\r\\nLaws! I knowed you de minute I sot eyes on you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that so, my boy?” (Handing him a quadruple fee.) “Who am I?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jenuel McClellan,” and he disappeared again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion said, vinegarishly, “Well, well! what do you say now?”\\r\\n Right there comes in the marvellous coincidence I mentioned a while\\r\\nago—viz., I was speechless, and that is my condition now. Perceive it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCATS AND CANDY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          The following address was delivered at a social meeting of\\r\\n          literary men in New York in 1874:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was fourteen I was living with my parents, who were very poor—and\\r\\ncorrespondently honest. We had a youth living with us by the name of\\r\\nJim Wolfe. He was an excellent fellow, seventeen years old, and very\\r\\ndiffident. He and I slept together—virtuously; and one bitter winter’s\\r\\nnight a cousin Mary—she’s married now and gone—gave what they call a\\r\\ncandy-pulling in those days in the West, and they took the saucers of\\r\\nhot candy outside of the house into the snow, under a sort of old bower\\r\\nthat came from the eaves—it was a sort of an ell then, all covered with\\r\\nvines—to cool this hot candy in the snow, and they were all sitting\\r\\nthere. In the mean time we were gone to bed. We were not invited to\\r\\nattend this party; we were too young.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young ladies and gentlemen were assembled there, and Jim and I were\\r\\nin bed. There was about four inches of snow on the roof of this ell,\\r\\nand our windows looked out on it; and it was frozen hard. A couple of\\r\\ntom-cats—it is possible one might have been of the opposite sex—were\\r\\nassembled on the chimney in the middle of this ell, and they were\\r\\ngrowling at a fearful rate, and switching their tails about and going\\r\\non, and we couldn’t sleep at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally Jim said, “For two cents I’d go out and snake them cats off that\\r\\nchimney.” So I said, “Of course you would.” He said, “Well, I would;\\r\\nI have a mighty good notion to do it.” Says I, “Of course you have;\\r\\ncertainly you have, you have a great notion to do it.” I hoped he might\\r\\ntry it, but I was afraid he wouldn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally I did get his ambition up, and he raised the window and climbed\\r\\nout on the icy roof, with nothing on but his socks and a very short\\r\\nshirt. He went climbing along on all fours on the roof toward the\\r\\nchimney where the cats were. In the mean time these young ladies and\\r\\ngentlemen were enjoying themselves down under the eaves, and when Jim\\r\\ngot almost to that chimney he made a pass at the cats, and his heels\\r\\nflew up and he shot down and crashed through those vines, and lit in the\\r\\nmidst of the ladies and gentlemen, and sat down in those hot saucers of\\r\\ncandy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a stampede, of course, and he came up-stairs dropping pieces\\r\\nof chinaware and candy all the way up, and when he got up there—now\\r\\nanybody in the world would have gone into profanity or something\\r\\ncalculated to relieve the mind, but he didn’t; he scraped the candy off\\r\\nhis legs, nursed his blisters a little, and said, “I could have ketched\\r\\nthem cats if I had had on a good ready.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Does any reader know what a “ready” was in 1840? D.W.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOBITUARY POETRY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE ACTORS’ FUND FAIR, PHILADELPHIA, in 1895\\r\\n\\r\\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN,—The—er this—er—welcome occasion gives me\\r\\nan—er—opportunity to make an—er—explanation that I have long desired to\\r\\ndeliver myself of. I rise to the highest honors before a Philadelphia\\r\\naudience. In the course of my checkered career I have, on divers\\r\\noccasions, been charged—er—maliciously with a more or less serious\\r\\noffence. It is in reply to one of the more—er—important of these that\\r\\nI wish to speak. More than once I have been accused of writing obituary\\r\\npoetry in the Philadelphia Ledger.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish right here to deny that dreadful assertion. I will admit that\\r\\nonce, when a compositor in the Ledger establishment, I did set up some\\r\\nof that poetry, but for a worse offence than that no indictment can be\\r\\nfound against me. I did not write that poetry—at least, not all of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCIGARS AND TOBACCO\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friends for some years now have remarked that I am an inveterate\\r\\nconsumer of tobacco. That is true, but my habits with regard to tobacco\\r\\nhave changed. I have no doubt that you will say, when I have explained\\r\\nto you what my present purpose is, that my taste has deteriorated, but I\\r\\ndo not so regard it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever I held a smoking-party at my house, I found that my guests had\\r\\nalways just taken the pledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me tell you briefly the history of my personal relation to tobacco.\\r\\nIt began, I think, when I was a lad, and took the form of a quid, which\\r\\nI became expert in tucking under my tongue. Afterward I learned the\\r\\ndelights of the pipe, and I suppose there was no other youngster of my\\r\\nage who could more deftly cut plug tobacco so as to make it available\\r\\nfor pipe-smoking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, time ran on, and there came a time when I was able to gratify one\\r\\nof my youthful ambitions—I could buy the choicest Havana cigars without\\r\\nseriously interfering with my income. I smoked a good many, changing off\\r\\nfrom the Havana cigars to the pipe in the course of a day’s smoking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last it occurred to me that something was lacking in the\\r\\nHavana cigar. It did not quite fulfil my youthful anticipations.\\r\\nI experimented. I bought what was called a seed-leaf cigar with a\\r\\nConnecticut wrapper. After a while I became satiated of these, and I\\r\\nsearched for something else, The Pittsburg stogy was recommended to me.\\r\\nIt certainly had the merit of cheapness, if that be a merit in tobacco,\\r\\nand I experimented with the stogy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, once more, I changed off, so that I might acquire the subtler\\r\\nflavor of the Wheeling toby. Now that palled, and I looked around New\\r\\nYork in the hope of finding cigars which would seem to most people vile,\\r\\nbut which, I am sure, would be ambrosial to me. I couldn’t find any.\\r\\nThey put into my hands some of those little things that cost ten cents a\\r\\nbox, but they are a delusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said to a friend, “I want to know if you can direct me to an honest\\r\\ntobacco merchant who will tell me what is the worst cigar in the New\\r\\nYork market, excepting those made for Chinese consumption—I want real\\r\\ntobacco. If you will do this and I find the man is as good as his word,\\r\\nI will guarantee him a regular market for a fair amount of his cigars.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe found a tobacco dealer who would tell the truth—who, if a cigar was\\r\\nbad, would boldly say so. He produced what he called the very worst\\r\\ncigars he had ever had in his shop. He let me experiment with one then\\r\\nand there. The test was satisfactory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was, after all, the real thing. I negotiated for a box of them and\\r\\ntook them away with me, so that I might be sure of having them handy\\r\\nwhen I want them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI discovered that the “worst cigars,” so called, are the best for me,\\r\\nafter all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBILLIARDS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens attended a billiard tourney on the evening of April\\r\\n          24, 1906, and was called on to tell a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition.\\r\\nOnce, when I was an underpaid reporter in Virginia City, whenever I\\r\\nwished to play billiards I went out to look for an easy mark. One day\\r\\na stranger came to town and opened a billiard parlor. I looked him over\\r\\ncasually. When he proposed a game, I answered, “All right.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just knock the balls around a little so that I can get your gait,” he\\r\\nsaid; and when I had done so, he remarked: “I will be perfectly\\r\\nfair with you. I’ll play you left-handed.” I felt hurt, for he was\\r\\ncross-eyed, freckled, and had red hair, and I determined to teach him a\\r\\nlesson. He won first shot, ran out, took my half-dollar, and all I got\\r\\nwas the opportunity to chalk my cue.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you can play like that with your left hand,” I said, “I’d like to\\r\\nsee you play with your right.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t,” he said. “I’m left-handed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE UNION RIGHT OR WRONG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          REMINISCENCES OF NEVADA\\r\\n\\r\\nI can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that Nevada had lively\\r\\nnewspapers in those days.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy great competitor among the reporters was Boggs, of the Union, an\\r\\nexcellent reporter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in three or four months he would get a little intoxicated; but,\\r\\nas a general thing, he was a wary and cautious drinker, although always\\r\\nready to damp himself a little with the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had the advantage of me in one thing: he could get the monthly\\r\\npublic-school report and I could not, because the principal hated my\\r\\nsheet—the ‘Enterprise’.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne snowy night, when the report was due, I started out, sadly wondering\\r\\nhow I was to get it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently, a few steps up the almost deserted street, I stumbled on\\r\\nBoggs, and asked him where he was going.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After the school report.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll go along with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Sir. I’ll excuse you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have it your own way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA saloon-keeper’s boy passed by with a steaming pitcher of hot punch,\\r\\nand Boggs snuffed the fragrance gratefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gazed fondly after the boy, and saw him start up the Enterprise\\r\\nstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish you could help me get that school business, but since you can’t,\\r\\nI must run up to the Union office and see if I can get a proof of it\\r\\nafter it’s set up, though I don’t begin to suppose I can. Good night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold on a minute. I don’t mind getting the report and sitting around\\r\\nwith the boys a little while you copy it, if you’re willing to drop down\\r\\nto the principal’s with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now you talk like a human being. Come along.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ploughed a couple of blocks through the snow, got the report—a short\\r\\ndocument—and soon copied it in our office.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, Boggs helped himself to the punch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave the manuscript back to him, and we started back to get an\\r\\ninquest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt four o’clock in the morning, when we had gone to press and were\\r\\nhaving a relaxing concert as usual (for some of the printers were good\\r\\nsingers and others good performers on the guitar and on that atrocity\\r\\nthe accordion), the proprietor of the Union strode in and asked if\\r\\nanybody had heard anything of Boggs or the school report.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stated the case, and all turned out to help hunt for the delinquent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe found him standing on a table in a saloon, with an old tin lantern\\r\\nin one hand and the school report in the other, haranguing a gang of\\r\\n“corned” miners on the iniquity of squandering the public money on\\r\\neducation “when hundreds and hundreds of honest, hard-working men were\\r\\nliterally starving for whiskey.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been assisting in a regal spree with those parties for hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dragged him away, and put him into bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course there was no school report in the Union, and Boggs held me\\r\\naccountable, though I was innocent of any intention or desire to compass\\r\\nits absence from that paper, and was as sorry as any one that the\\r\\nmisfortune had occurred. But we were perfectly friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day the next school report was due the proprietor of the Tennessee\\r\\nMine furnished us a buggy, and asked us to go down and write something\\r\\nabout the property—a very common request, and one always gladly acceded\\r\\nto when people furnished buggies, for we were as fond of pleasure\\r\\nexcursions as other people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “mine” was a hole in the ground ninety feet deep, and no way of\\r\\ngetting down into it but by holding on to a rope and being lowered with\\r\\na windlass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe workmen had just gone off somewhere to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not strong enough to lower Boggs’s bulk, so I took an unlighted\\r\\ncandle in my teeth, made a loop for my foot in the end of the rope,\\r\\nimplored Boggs not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the start of\\r\\nhim, and then swung out over the shaft.\\r\\n\\r\\nI reached the bottom muddy and bruised about the elbows, but safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lit the candle, made an examination of the rock, selected some\\r\\nspecimens, and shouted to Boggs to hoist away.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently a head appeared in the circle of daylight away aloft, and a\\r\\nvoice came down:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you all set?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All set-hoist away!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you comfortable?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perfectly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Could you wait a little?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, certainly-no particular hurry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well-good-bye.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, where are you going?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“After the school report!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he did.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stayed down there an hour, and surprised the workmen when they hauled\\r\\nup and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked home, too—five miles-up-hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had no school report next morning—but the Union had.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAN IDEAL FRENCH ADDRESS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     EXTRACT FROM “PARIS NOTES,” IN “TOM SAWYER ABROAD,” ETC.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am told that a French sermon is like a French speech—it never names an\\r\\nhistorical event, but only the date of it; if you are not up in dates,\\r\\nyou get left. A French speech is something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Comrades, citizens, brothers, noble parts of the only sublime and\\r\\nperfect nation, let us not forget that the 21st January cast off our\\r\\nchains; that the 10th August relieved us of the shameful presence of\\r\\nforeign spies; that the 5th September was its own justification before\\r\\nHeaven and humanity; that the 18th Brumaire contained the seeds of\\r\\nits own punishment; that the 14th July was the mighty voice of liberty\\r\\nproclaiming the resurrection, the new day, and inviting the oppressed\\r\\npeoples of the earth to look upon the divine face of France and live;\\r\\nand let us here record our everlasting curse against the man of the 2d\\r\\nDecember, and declare in thunder tones, the native tones of France, that\\r\\nbut for him there had been no 17th March in history, no 12th October,\\r\\nnor 9th January, no 22d April, no 16th November, no 30th September,\\r\\nno 2d July, no 14th February, no 29th June, no 15th August, no 31st\\r\\nMay—that but for him, France, the pure, the grand, the peerless, had had\\r\\na serene and vacant almanac to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI have heard of one French sermon which closed in this odd yet eloquent\\r\\nway:\\r\\n\\r\\n“My hearers, we have sad cause to remember the man of the 13th January.\\r\\nThe results of the vast crime of the 13th January have been in just\\r\\nproportion to the magnitude of the act itself. But for it there had been\\r\\nno 30th November—sorrowful spectacle! The grisly deed of the 16th June\\r\\nhad not been done but for it, nor had the man of the 16th June known\\r\\nexistence; to it alone the 3d September was due, also the fatal 12th\\r\\nOctober. Shall we, then, be grateful for the 13th January, with its\\r\\nfreight of death for you and me and all that breathe? Yes, my friends,\\r\\nfor it gave us also that which had never come but for it, and it\\r\\nalone—the blessed 25th December.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be well enough to explain. The man of the 13th January is Adam;\\r\\nthe crime of that date was the eating of the apple; the sorrowful\\r\\nspectacle of the 30th November was the expulsion from Eden; the\\r\\ngrisly deed of the 16th June was the murder of Abel; the act of the 3d\\r\\nSeptember was the beginning of the journey to the land of Nod; the 12th\\r\\nday of October, the last mountaintops disappeared under the flood.\\r\\nWhen you go to church in France, you want to take your almanac with\\r\\nyou—annotated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSTATISTICS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          EXTRACT FROM “THE HISTORY OF THE SAVAGE CLUB”\\r\\n\\r\\n          During that period of gloom when domestic bereavement had\\r\\n          forced Mr. Clemens and his dear ones to secure the privacy they\\r\\n          craved until their wounds should heal, his address was known to\\r\\n          only a very few of his closest friends.  One old friend in New\\r\\n          York, after vain efforts to get his address, wrote him a letter\\r\\n          addressed as follows\\r\\n\\r\\n                    MARK TWAIN,\\r\\n                         God Knows Where,\\r\\n                                   Try London.\\r\\n\\r\\n          The letter found him, and Mr. Clemens replied to the letter\\r\\n          expressing himself surprised and complimented that the person\\r\\n          who was credited with knowing his whereabouts should take so\\r\\n          much interest in him, adding: “Had the letter been addressed to\\r\\n          the care of the ‘other party,’ I would naturally have expected\\r\\n          to receive it without delay.”\\r\\n\\r\\n          His correspondent tried again, and addressed the second letter:\\r\\n\\r\\n                    MARK TWAIN,\\r\\n                         The Devil Knows Where,\\r\\n                              Try London.\\r\\n\\r\\n          This found him also no less promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n          On June 9, 1899, he consented to visit the Savage Club, London,\\r\\n          on condition that there was to be no publicity and no speech\\r\\n          was to be expected from him.  The toastmaster, in proposing the\\r\\n          health of their guest, said that as a Scotchman, and therefore\\r\\n          as a born expert, he thought Mark Twain had little or no claim\\r\\n          to the title of humorist.  Mr. Clemens had tried to be funny\\r\\n          but had failed, and his true role in life was statistics; that\\r\\n          he was a master of statistics, and loved them for their own\\r\\n          sake, and it would be the easiest task he ever undertook if he\\r\\n          would try to count all the real jokes he had ever made.  While\\r\\n          the toastmaster was speaking, the members saw Mr. Clemens’s\\r\\n          eyes begin to sparkle and his cheeks to flush.  He jumped up,\\r\\n          and made a characteristic speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps I am not a humorist, but I am a first-class fool—a simpleton;\\r\\nfor up to this moment I have believed Chairman MacAlister to be a decent\\r\\nperson whom I could allow to mix up with my friends and relatives. The\\r\\nexhibition he has just made of himself reveals him to be a scoundrel and\\r\\na knave of the deepest dye. I have been cruelly deceived, and it serves\\r\\nme right for trusting a Scotchman. Yes, I do understand figures, and I\\r\\ncan count. I have counted the words in MacAlister’s drivel (I certainly\\r\\ncannot call it a speech), and there were exactly three thousand four\\r\\nhundred and thirty-nine. I also carefully counted the lies—there were\\r\\nexactly three thousand four hundred and thirty-nine. Therefore, I leave\\r\\nMacAlister to his fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was sorry to have my name mentioned as one of the great authors,\\r\\nbecause they have a sad habit of dying off. Chaucer is dead, Spencer is\\r\\ndead, so is Milton, so is Shakespeare, and I am not feeling very well\\r\\nmyself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGALVESTON ORPHAN BAZAAR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT A FAIR HELD AT THE WALDORF-ASTORIA, NEW YORK, IN\\r\\n          OCTOBER, 1900, IN AID OF THE ORPHANS AT GALVESTON\\r\\n\\r\\nI expected that the Governor of Texas would occupy this place first and\\r\\nwould speak to you, and in the course of his remarks would drop a\\r\\ntext for me to talk from; but with the proverbial obstinacy that is\\r\\nproverbial with governors, they go back on their duties, and he has not\\r\\ncome here, and has not furnished me with a text, and I am here without\\r\\na text. I have no text except what you furnish me with your handsome\\r\\nfaces, and—but I won’t continue that, for I could go on forever about\\r\\nattractive faces, beautiful dresses, and other things. But, after all,\\r\\ncompliments should be in order in a place like this.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been in New York two or three days, and have been in a condition\\r\\nof strict diligence night and day, the object of this diligence being\\r\\nto regulate the moral and political situation on this planet—put it on\\r\\na sound basis—and when you are regulating the conditions of a planet it\\r\\nrequires a great deal of talk in a great many kinds of ways, and when\\r\\nyou have talked a lot the emptier you get, and get also in a position\\r\\nof corking. When I am situated like that, with nothing to say, I feel as\\r\\nthough I were a sort of fraud; I seem to be playing a part, and please\\r\\nconsider I am playing a part for want of something better, and this is\\r\\nnot unfamiliar to me; I have often done this before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was here about eight years ago I was coming up in a car of the\\r\\nelevated road. Very few people were in that car, and on one end of it\\r\\nthere was no one, except on the opposite seat, where sat a man about\\r\\nfifty years old, with a most winning face and an elegant eye—a beautiful\\r\\neye; and I took him from his dress to be a master mechanic, a man who\\r\\nhad a vocation. He had with him a very fine little child of about four\\r\\nor five years. I was watching the affection which existed between those\\r\\ntwo. I judged he was the grandfather, perhaps. It was really a pretty\\r\\nchild, and I was admiring her, and as soon as he saw I was admiring her\\r\\nhe began to notice me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see his admiration of me in his eye, and I did what everybody\\r\\nelse would do—admired the child four times as much, knowing I would get\\r\\nfour times as much of his admiration. Things went on very pleasantly. I\\r\\nwas making my way into his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy-and-by, when he almost reached the station where he was to get off,\\r\\nhe got up, crossed over, and he said: “Now I am going to say something\\r\\nto you which I hope you will regard as a compliment.” And then he went\\r\\non to say: “I have never seen Mark Twain, but I have seen a portrait of\\r\\nhim, and any friend of mine will tell you that when I have once seen a\\r\\nportrait of a man I place it in my eye and store it away in my memory,\\r\\nand I can tell you now that you look enough like Mark Twain to be his\\r\\nbrother. Now,” he said, “I hope you take this as a compliment. Yes,\\r\\nyou are a very good imitation; but when I come to look closer, you are\\r\\nprobably not that man.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI said: “I will be frank with you. In my desire to look like that\\r\\nexcellent character I have dressed for the character; I have been\\r\\nplaying a part.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said: “That is all right, that is all right; you look very well on\\r\\nthe outside, but when it comes to the inside you are not in it with the\\r\\noriginal.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo when I come to a place like this with nothing valuable to say I\\r\\nalways play a part. But I will say before I sit down that when it comes\\r\\nto saying anything here I will express myself in this way: I am heartily\\r\\nin sympathy with you in your efforts to help those who were sufferers\\r\\nin this calamity, and in your desire to help those who were rendered\\r\\nhomeless, and in saying this I wish to impress on you the fact that I am\\r\\nnot playing a part.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          After the address at the Robert Fulton Fund meeting, June 19,\\r\\n          1906, Mr. Clemens talked to the assembled reporters about the\\r\\n          San Francisco earthquake.\\r\\n\\r\\nI haven’t been there since 1868, and that great city of San Francisco\\r\\nhas grown up since my day. When I was there she had one hundred and\\r\\neighteen thousand people, and of this number eighteen thousand were\\r\\nChinese. I was a reporter on the Virginia City Enterprise in Nevada in\\r\\n1862, and stayed there, I think, about two years, when I went to San\\r\\nFrancisco and got a job as a reporter on The Call. I was there three or\\r\\nfour years.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember one day I was walking down Third Street in San Francisco. It\\r\\nwas a sleepy, dull Sunday afternoon, and no one was stirring. Suddenly\\r\\nas I looked up the street about three hundred yards the whole side of\\r\\na house fell out. The street was full of bricks and mortar. At the same\\r\\ntime I was knocked against the side of a house, and stood there stunned\\r\\nfor a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought it was an earthquake. Nobody else had heard anything about it\\r\\nand no one said earthquake to me afterward, but I saw it and I wrote\\r\\nit. Nobody else wrote it, and the house I saw go into the street was the\\r\\nonly house in the city that felt it. I’ve always wondered if it wasn’t a\\r\\nlittle performance gotten up for my especial entertainment by the nether\\r\\nregions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHARITY AND ACTORS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE ACTORS’ FUND FAIR IN THE METROPOLITAN\\r\\n          OPERA HOUSE, NEW YORK, MAY 6, 1907\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens, in his white suit, formally declared the fair\\r\\n          open.  Mr. Daniel Frohman, in introducing Mr. Clemens, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n          “We intend to make this a banner week in the history of the\\r\\n          Fund, which takes an interest in every one on the stage, be he\\r\\n          actor, singer, dancer, or workman.  We have spent more than\\r\\n          $40,000 during the past year.  Charity covers a multitude of\\r\\n          sins, but it also reveals a multitude of virtues.  At the\\r\\n          opening of the former fair we had the assistance of Edwin Booth\\r\\n          and Joseph Jefferson.  In their place we have to-day that\\r\\n          American institution and apostle of wide humanity--Mark Twain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mr. Frohman has said, charity reveals a multitude of virtues. This is\\r\\ntrue, and it is to be proved here before the week is over. Mr. Frohman\\r\\nhas told you something of the object and something of the character of\\r\\nthe work. He told me he would do this—and he has kept his word! I had\\r\\nexpected to hear of it through the newspapers. I wouldn’t trust anything\\r\\nbetween Frohman and the newspapers—except when it’s a case of charity!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should all remember that the actor has been your benefactor many and\\r\\nmany a year. When you have been weary and downcast he has lifted your\\r\\nheart out of gloom and given you a fresh impulse. You are all under\\r\\nobligation to him. This is your opportunity to be his benefactor—to help\\r\\nprovide for him in his old age and when he suffers from infirmities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this fair no one is to be persecuted to buy. If you offer a\\r\\ntwenty-dollar bill in payment for a purchase of $1 you will receive\\r\\n$19 in change. There is to be no robbery here. There is to be no creed\\r\\nhere—no religion except charity. We want to raise $250,000—and that is a\\r\\ngreat task to attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President has set the fair in motion by pressing the button in\\r\\nWashington. Now your good wishes are to be transmuted into cash.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy virtue of the authority in me vested I declare the fair open. I call\\r\\nthe ball game. Let the transmuting begin!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRUSSIAN REPUBLIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n      The American auxiliary movement to aid the cause of freedom in Russia was\\r\\n      launched on the evening of April 11, 1906, at the Club A house, 3 Fifth\\r\\n      Avenue, with Mr. Clemens and Maxim Gorky as the principal spokesmen. Mr.\\r\\n      Clemens made an introductory address, presenting Mr. Gorky.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we can build a Russian republic to give to the persecuted people of\\r\\nthe Tsar’s domain the same measure of freedom that we enjoy, let us go\\r\\nahead and do it. We need not discuss the methods by which that purpose\\r\\nis to be attained. Let us hope that fighting will be postponed or\\r\\naverted for a while, but if it must come—\\r\\n\\r\\nI am most emphatically in sympathy with the movement, now on foot\\r\\nin Russia, to make that country free. I am certain that it will be\\r\\nsuccessful, as it deserves to be. Any such movement should have and\\r\\ndeserves our earnest and unanimous co-operation, and such a petition for\\r\\nfunds as has been explained by Mr. Hunter, with its just and powerful\\r\\nmeaning, should have the utmost support of each and every one of us.\\r\\nAnybody whose ancestors were in this country when we were trying to free\\r\\nourselves from oppression, must sympathize with those who now are trying\\r\\nto do the same thing in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parallel I have just drawn only goes to show that it makes no\\r\\ndifference whether the oppression is bitter or not; men with red, warm\\r\\nblood in their veins will not endure it, but will seek to cast it off.\\r\\nIf we keep our hearts in this matter Russia will be free.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRUSSIAN SUFFERERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          On December 18, 1905, an entertainment was given at the Casino\\r\\n          for the benefit of the Russian sufferers.  After the\\r\\n          performance Mr. Clemens spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN,—It seems a sort of cruelty to inflict upon an\\r\\naudience like this our rude English tongue, after we have heard that\\r\\ndivine speech flowing in that lucid Gallic tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has always been a marvel to me—that French language; it has always\\r\\nbeen a puzzle to me. How beautiful that language is. How expressive it\\r\\nseems to be. How full of grace it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when it comes from lips like those, how eloquent and how liquid\\r\\nit is. And, oh, I am always deceived—I always think I am going to\\r\\nunderstand it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, it is such a delight to me, such a delight to me, to meet Madame\\r\\nBernhardt, and laugh hand to hand and heart to heart with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have seen her play, as we all have, and oh, that is divine; but I have\\r\\nalways wanted to know Madame Bernhardt herself—her fiery self. I have\\r\\nwanted to know that beautiful character.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, she is the youngest person I ever saw, except myself—for I always\\r\\nfeel young when I come in the presence of young people.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a pleasant recollection of an incident so many years ago—when\\r\\nMadame Bernhardt came to Hartford, where I lived, and she was going\\r\\nto play and the tickets were three dollars, and there were two lovely\\r\\nwomen—a widow and her daughter—neighbors of ours, highly cultivated\\r\\nladies they were; their tastes were fine and elevated, but they were\\r\\nvery poor, and they said “Well, we must not spend six dollars on a\\r\\npleasure of the mind, a pleasure of the intellect; we must spend it, if\\r\\nit must go at all, to furnish to somebody bread to eat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so they sorrowed over the fact that they had to give up that great\\r\\npleasure of seeing Madame Bernhardt, but there were two neighbors\\r\\nequally highly cultivated and who could not afford bread, and those\\r\\ngood-hearted Joneses sent that six dollars—deprived themselves of it—and\\r\\nsent it to those poor Smiths to buy bread with. And those Smiths took it\\r\\nand bought tickets with it to see Madame Bernhardt.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh yes, some people have tastes and intelligence also.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I was going to make a speech—I supposed I was, but I am not. It\\r\\nis late, late; and so I am going to tell a story; and there is this\\r\\nadvantage about a story, anyway, that whatever moral or valuable thing\\r\\nyou put into a speech, why, it gets diffused among those involuted\\r\\nsentences and possibly your audience goes away without finding out what\\r\\nthat valuable thing was that you were trying to confer upon it; but,\\r\\ndear me, you put the same jewel into a story and it becomes the keystone\\r\\nof that story, and you are bound to get it—it flashes, it flames, it is\\r\\nthe jewel in the toad’s head—you don’t overlook that.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if I am going to talk on such a subject as, for instance, the lost\\r\\nopportunity—oh, the lost opportunity. Anybody in this house who has\\r\\nreached the turn of life—sixty, or seventy, or even fifty, or along\\r\\nthere—when he goes back along his history, there he finds it mile-stoned\\r\\nall the way with the lost opportunity, and you know how pathetic that\\r\\nis.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou younger ones cannot know the full pathos that lies in those\\r\\nwords—the lost opportunity; but anybody who is old, who has really lived\\r\\nand felt this life, he knows the pathos of the lost opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I will tell you a story whose moral is that, whose lesson is that,\\r\\nwhose lament is that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was in a village which is a suburb of New Bedford several years\\r\\nago—well, New Bedford is a suburb of Fair Haven, or perhaps it is the\\r\\nother way; in any case, it took both of those towns to make a great\\r\\ncentre of the great whaling industry of the first half of the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury, and I was up there at Fair Haven some years ago with a friend\\r\\nof mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a dedication of a great town-hall, a public building, and we\\r\\nwere there in the afternoon. This great building was filled, like this\\r\\ngreat theatre, with rejoicing villagers, and my friend and I started\\r\\ndown the centre aisle. He saw a man standing in that aisle, and he said\\r\\n“Now, look at that bronzed veteran—at that mahogany-faced man. Now, tell\\r\\nme, do you see anything about that man’s face that is emotional? Do you\\r\\nsee anything about it that suggests that inside that man anywhere there\\r\\nare fires that can be started? Would you ever imagine that that is a\\r\\nhuman volcano?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, no,” I said, “I would not. He looks like a wooden Indian in front\\r\\nof a cigar store.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” said my friend, “I will show you that there is emotion even\\r\\nin that unpromising place. I will just go to that man and I will just\\r\\nmention in the most casual way an incident in his life. That man is\\r\\ngetting along toward ninety years old. He is past eighty. I will mention\\r\\nan incident of fifty or sixty years ago. Now, just watch the effect, and\\r\\nit will be so casual that if you don’t watch you won’t know when I do\\r\\nsay that thing—but you just watch the effect.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on down there and accosted this antiquity, and made a remark\\r\\nor two. I could not catch up. They were so casual I could not recognize\\r\\nwhich one it was that touched that bottom, for in an instant that old\\r\\nman was literally in eruption and was filling the whole place with\\r\\nprofanity of the most exquisite kind. You never heard such accomplished\\r\\nprofanity. I never heard it also delivered with such eloquence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI never enjoyed profanity as I enjoyed it then—more than if I had been\\r\\nuttering it myself. There is nothing like listening to an artist—all\\r\\nhis passions passing away in lava, smoke, thunder, lightning, and\\r\\nearthquake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen this friend said to me: “Now, I will tell you about that. About\\r\\nsixty years ago that man was a young fellow of twenty-three, and had\\r\\njust come home from a three years’ whaling voyage. He came into that\\r\\nvillage of his, happy and proud because now, instead of being chief\\r\\nmate, he was going to be master of a whaleship, and he was proud and\\r\\nhappy about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then he found that there had been a kind of a cold frost come upon that\\r\\ntown and the whole region roundabout; for while he had been away the\\r\\nFather Mathew temperance excitement had come upon the whole region.\\r\\nTherefore, everybody had taken the pledge; there wasn’t anybody for\\r\\nmiles and miles around that had not taken the pledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you can see what a solitude it was to this young man, who was fond\\r\\nof his grog. And he was just an outcast, because when they found he\\r\\nwould not join Father Mathew’s Society they ostracized him, and he went\\r\\nabout that town three weeks, day and night, in utter loneliness—the only\\r\\nhuman being in the whole place who ever took grog, and he had to take it\\r\\nprivately.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you don’t know what it is to be ostracized, to be shunned by your\\r\\nfellow-man, may you never know it. Then he recognized that there\\r\\nwas something more valuable in this life than grog, and that is the\\r\\nfellowship of your fellow-man. And at last he gave it up, and at nine\\r\\no’clock one night he went down to the Father Mathew Temperance Society,\\r\\nand with a broken heart he said: ‘Put my name down for membership in\\r\\nthis society.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“And then he went away crying, and at earliest dawn the next morning\\r\\nthey came for him and routed him out, and they said that new ship of his\\r\\nwas ready to sail on a three years’ voyage. In a minute he was on board\\r\\nthat ship and gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And he said—well, he was not out of sight of that town till he began to\\r\\nrepent, but he had made up his mind that he would not take a drink, and\\r\\nso that whole voyage of three years was a three years’ agony to that man\\r\\nbecause he saw all the time the mistake he had made.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He felt it all through; he had constant reminders of it, because the\\r\\ncrew would pass him with their grog, come out on the deck and take it,\\r\\nand there was the torturous Smell of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He went through the whole, three years of suffering, and at last coming\\r\\ninto port it was snowy, it was cold, he was stamping through the snow\\r\\ntwo feet deep on the deck and longing to get home, and there was his\\r\\ncrew torturing him to the last minute with hot grog, but at last he had\\r\\nhis reward. He really did get to shore at last, and jumped and ran\\r\\nand bought a jug and rushed to the society’s office, and said to the\\r\\nsecretary:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Take my name off your membership books, and do it right away! I have\\r\\ngot a three years’ thirst on.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the secretary said: ‘It is not necessary. You were blackballed!’”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWATTERSON AND TWAIN AS REBELS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE CELEBRATION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN’S 92ND BIRTHDAY\\r\\n          ANNIVERSARY, CARNEGIE HALL, FEBRUARY 11, 1901, TO RAISE FUNDS\\r\\n          FOR THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL UNIVERSITY AT CUMBERLAND GAP, TENN.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN,—The remainder of my duties as presiding chairman\\r\\nhere this evening are but two—only two. One of them is easy, and the\\r\\nother difficult. That is to say, I must introduce the orator, and then\\r\\nkeep still and give him a chance. The name of Henry Watterson carries\\r\\nwith it its own explanation. It is like an electric light on top of\\r\\nMadison Square Garden; you touch the button and the light flashes up out\\r\\nof the darkness. You mention the name of Henry Watterson, and your\\r\\nminds are at once illuminated with the splendid radiance of his fame and\\r\\nachievements. A journalist, a soldier, an orator, a statesman, a rebel.\\r\\nYes, he was a rebel; and, better still, now he is a reconstructed rebel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a curious circumstance, a circumstance brought about without any\\r\\ncollusion or prearrangement, that he and I, both of whom were rebels\\r\\nrelated by blood to each other, should be brought here together this\\r\\nevening bearing a tribute in our hands and bowing our heads in reverence\\r\\nto that noble soul who for three years we tried to destroy. I don’t\\r\\nknow as the fact has ever been mentioned before, but it is a fact,\\r\\nnevertheless. Colonel Watterson and I were both rebels, and we are blood\\r\\nrelations. I was a second lieutenant in a Confederate company for a\\r\\nwhile—oh, I could have stayed on if I had wanted to. I made myself felt,\\r\\nI left tracks all around the country. I could have stayed on, but it was\\r\\nsuch weather. I never saw such weather to be out-of-doors in, in all my\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colonel commanded a regiment, and did his part, I suppose, to\\r\\ndestroy the Union. He did not succeed, yet if he had obeyed me he would\\r\\nhave done so. I had a plan, and I fully intended to drive General Grant\\r\\ninto the Pacific Ocean—if I could get transportation. I told Colonel\\r\\nWatterson about it. I told him what he had to do. What I wanted him to\\r\\ndo was to surround the Eastern army and wait until I came up. But he was\\r\\ninsubordinate; he stuck on some quibble of military etiquette about a\\r\\nsecond lieutenant giving orders to a colonel or something like that.\\r\\nAnd what was the consequence? The Union was preserved. This is the first\\r\\ntime I believe that that secret has ever been revealed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one outside of the family circle, I think, knew it before; but there\\r\\nthe facts are. Watterson saved the Union; yes, he saved the Union. And\\r\\nyet there he sits, and not a step has been taken or a movement made\\r\\ntoward granting him a pension. That is the way things are done. It is\\r\\na case where some blushing ought to be done. You ought to blush, and I\\r\\nought to blush, and he—well, he’s a little out of practice now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nROBERT FULTON FUND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS MADE ON THE EVENING OF APRIL 19, 1906\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens had been asked to address the association by Gen.\\r\\n          Frederick D. Grant, president.  He was offered a fee of $1,000,\\r\\n          but refused it, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n          “I shall be glad to do it, but I must stipulate that you keep\\r\\n          the $1,000, and add it to the Memorial Fund as my contribution\\r\\n          to erect a monument in New York to the memory of the man who\\r\\n          applied steam to navigation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n          At this meeting Mr. Clemens made this formal announcement from\\r\\n          the platform:\\r\\n\\r\\n          “This is my last appearance on the paid platform.  I shall not\\r\\n          retire from the gratis platform until I am buried, and courtesy\\r\\n          will compel me to keep still and not disturb the others.  Now,\\r\\n          since I must, I shall say good-bye.  I see many faces in this\\r\\n          audience well known to me.  They are all my friends, and I feel\\r\\n          that those I don’t know are my friends, too.  I wish to\\r\\n          consider that you represent the nation, and  that in saying\\r\\n          good-bye to you I am saying good-bye to the nation.  In the\\r\\n          great name of humanity, let me say this final word: I offer an\\r\\n          appeal in behalf of that vast, pathetic multitude of fathers,\\r\\n          mothers, and helpless little children.  They were sheltered and\\r\\n          happy two days ago.  Now they are wandering, forlorn, hopeless,\\r\\n          and homeless, the victims of a great disaster.  So I beg of\\r\\n          you, I beg of you, to open your hearts and open your purses and\\r\\n          remember San Francisco, the smitten city.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish to deliver a historical address. I’ve been studying the history\\r\\nof—-er—a—let me see—a [then he stopped in confusion, and walked over to\\r\\nGen. Fred D. Grant, who sat at the head of the platform. He leaned\\r\\nover in a whisper, and then returned to the front of the stage and\\r\\ncontinued]. Oh yes! I’ve been studying Robert Fulton. I’ve been studying\\r\\na biographical sketch of Robert Fulton, the inventor of—er—a—let’s\\r\\nsee—ah yes, the inventor of the electric telegraph and the Morse\\r\\nsewing—machine. Also, I understand he invented the air—diria—pshaw! I\\r\\nhave it at last—the dirigible balloon. Yes, the dirigible—but it is a\\r\\ndifficult word, and I don’t see why anybody should marry a couple of\\r\\nwords like that when they don’t want to be married at all and are likely\\r\\nto quarrel with each other all the time. I should put that couple\\r\\nof words under the ban of the United States Supreme Court, under its\\r\\ndecision of a few days ago, and take ‘em out and drown ‘em.\\r\\n\\r\\nI used to know Fulton. It used to do me good to see him dashing through\\r\\nthe town on a wild broncho.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Fulton was born in—-er—a—Well, it doesn’t make much difference where\\r\\nhe was born, does it? I remember a man who came to interview me once,\\r\\nto get a sketch of my life. I consulted with a friend—a practical\\r\\nman—before he came, to know how I should treat him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whenever you give the interviewer a fact,” he said, “give him another\\r\\nfact that will contradict it. Then he’ll go away with a jumble that\\r\\nhe can’t use at all. Be gentle, be sweet, smile like an idiot—just be\\r\\nnatural.” That’s what my friend told me to do, and I did it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where were you born?” asked the interviewer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well-er-a,” I began, “I was born in Alabama, or Alaska, or the Sandwich\\r\\nIslands; I don’t know where, but right around there somewhere. And you\\r\\nhad better put it down before you forget it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you weren’t born in all those places,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ve offered you three places. Take your choice. They’re all at\\r\\nthe same price.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How old are you?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be nineteen in June,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, there’s such a discrepancy between your age and your looks,” he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s nothing,” I said, “I was born discrepantly.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we got to talking about my brother Samuel, and he told me my\\r\\nexplanations were confusing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose he is dead,” I said. “Some said that he was dead and some\\r\\nsaid that he wasn’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you bury him without knowing whether he was dead or not?” asked the\\r\\nreporter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was a mystery,” said I. “We were twins, and one day when we were\\r\\ntwo weeks old—that is, he was one week old, and I was one week old—we\\r\\ngot mixed up in the bath-tub, and one of us drowned. We never could tell\\r\\nwhich. One of us had a strawberry birthmark on the back of his hand.\\r\\nThere it is on my hand. This is the one that was drowned. There’s no\\r\\ndoubt about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where’s the mystery?” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, don’t you see how stupid it was to bury the wrong twin?” I\\r\\nanswered. I didn’t explain it any more because he said the explanation\\r\\nconfused him. To me it is perfectly plain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, to get back to Fulton. I’m going along like an old man I used to\\r\\nknow who used to start to tell a story about his grandfather. He had an\\r\\nawfully retentive memory, and he never finished the story, because\\r\\nhe switched off into something else. He used to tell about how his\\r\\ngrandfather one day went into a pasture, where there was a ram. The old\\r\\nman dropped a silver dime in the grass, and stooped over to pick it\\r\\nup. The ram was observing him, and took the old man’s action as an\\r\\ninvitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he was going to finish about the ram this friend of mine would\\r\\nrecall that his grandfather had a niece who had a glass eye. She used\\r\\nto loan that glass eye to another lady friend, who used it when she\\r\\nreceived company. The eye didn’t fit the friend’s face, and it was\\r\\nloose. And whenever she winked it would turn over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he got on the subject of accidents, and he would tell a story about\\r\\nhow he believed accidents never happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was an Irishman coming down a ladder with a hod of bricks,” he\\r\\nsaid, “and a Dutchman was standing on the ground below. The Irishman\\r\\nfell on the Dutchman and killed him. Accident? Never! If the Dutchman\\r\\nhadn’t been there the Irishman would have been killed. Why didn’t the\\r\\nIrishman fall on a dog which was next to the Dutchman? Because the dog\\r\\nwould have seen him coming.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he’d get off from the Dutchman to an uncle named Reginald Wilson.\\r\\nReginald went into a carpet factory one day, and got twisted into the\\r\\nmachinery’s belt. He went excursioning around the factory until he was\\r\\nproperly distributed and was woven into sixty-nine yards of the best\\r\\nthree-ply carpet. His wife bought the carpet, and then she erected a\\r\\nmonument to his memory. It read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Sacred to the memory\\r\\n                                   of\\r\\n             sixty-nine yards of the best three-ply carpet\\r\\n                  containing the mortal remainders of\\r\\n\\r\\n                            REGINALD WILSON\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Go thou and do likewise\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so on he would ramble about telling the story of his grandfather\\r\\nuntil we never were told whether he found the ten-cent piece or whether\\r\\nsomething else happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFULTON DAY, JAMESTOWN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS DELIVERED SEPTEMBER 23, 1907\\r\\n\\r\\n          Lieutenant-Governor Ellyson, of Virginia, in introducing Mr.\\r\\n          Clemens, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n          “The people have come here to bring a tribute of affectionate\\r\\n          recollection for the man who has contributed so much to the\\r\\n          progress of the world and the happiness of mankind.”  As Mr.\\r\\n          Clemens came down to the platform the applause became louder\\r\\n          and louder, until Mr. Clemens held out his hand for silence.\\r\\n          It was a great triumph, and it was almost a minute after the\\r\\n          applause ceased before Mr. Clemens could speak.  He attempted\\r\\n          it once, and when the audience noticed his emotion, it cheered\\r\\n          again loudly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN,—I am but human, and when you, give me a reception\\r\\nlike that I am obliged to wait a little while I get my voice. When you\\r\\nappeal to my head, I don’t feel it; but when you appeal to my heart, I\\r\\ndo feel it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are here to celebrate one of the greatest events of American history,\\r\\nand not only in American history, but in the world’s history.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed it was—the application of steam by Robert Fulton.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a world event—there are not many of them. It is peculiarly\\r\\nan American event, that is true, but the influence was very broad in\\r\\neffect. We should regard this day as a very great American holiday. We\\r\\nhave not many that are exclusively American holidays. We have the Fourth\\r\\nof July, which we regard as an American holiday, but it is nothing of\\r\\nthe kind. I am waiting for a dissenting voice. All great efforts that\\r\\nled up to the Fourth of July were made, not by Americans, but by English\\r\\nresidents of America, subjects of the King of England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey fought all the fighting that was done, they shed and spilt all the\\r\\nblood that was spilt, in securing to us the invaluable liberties which\\r\\nare incorporated in the Declaration of Independence; but they were not\\r\\nAmericans. They signed the Declaration of Independence; no American’s\\r\\nname is signed to that document at all. There never was an American such\\r\\nas you and I are until after the Revolution, when it had all been fought\\r\\nout and liberty secured, after the adoption of the Constitution, and the\\r\\nrecognition of the Independence of America by all powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we revere the Fourth of July—and let us always revere it, and the\\r\\nliberties it conferred upon us—yet it was not an American event, a great\\r\\nAmerican day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an American who applied that steam successfully. There are not\\r\\na great many world events, and we have our full share. The telegraph,\\r\\ntelephone, and the application of steam to navigation—these are great\\r\\nAmerican events.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-day I have been requested, or I have requested myself, not to confine\\r\\nmyself to furnishing you with information, but to remind you of things,\\r\\nand to introduce one of the nation’s celebrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Harrington here is going to tell you all that I have left\\r\\nuntold. I am going to tell you all that I know, and then he will follow\\r\\nup with such rags and remnants as he can find, and tell you what he\\r\\nknows.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt you have heard a great deal about Robert Fulton and the\\r\\ninfluences that have grown from his invention, but the little steamboat\\r\\nis suffering neglect.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou probably do not know a great deal about that boat. It was the\\r\\nmost important steamboat in the world. I was there and saw it. Admiral\\r\\nHarrington was there at the time. It need not surprise you, for he is\\r\\nnot as old as he looks. That little boat was interesting in every way.\\r\\nThe size of it. The boat was one [consults Admiral], he said ten feet\\r\\nlong. The breadth of that boat [consults Admiral], two hundred feet.\\r\\nYou see, the first and most important detail is the length, then the\\r\\nbreadth, and then the depth; the depth of that boat was [consults\\r\\nagain]—the Admiral says it was a flat boat. Then her tonnage—you know\\r\\nnothing about a boat until you know two more things: her speed and her\\r\\ntonnage. We know the speed she made. She made four miles—-and sometimes\\r\\nfive miles. It was on her initial trip, on, August 11, 1807, that she\\r\\nmade her initial trip, when she went from [consults Admiral] Jersey\\r\\nCity—to Chicago. That’s right. She went by way of Albany. Now comes\\r\\nthe tonnage of that boat. Tonnage of a boat means the amount of\\r\\ndisplacement; displacement means the amount of water a vessel can shove\\r\\nin a day. The tonnage of man is estimated by the amount of whiskey he\\r\\ncan displace in a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Fulton named the ‘Clermont’ in honor of his bride, that is,\\r\\nClermont was the name of the county-seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel that it surprises you that I know so much. In my remarks of\\r\\nwelcome of Admiral Harrington I am not going to give him compliments.\\r\\nCompliments always embarrass a man. You do not know anything to say. It\\r\\ndoes not inspire you with words. There is nothing you can say in answer\\r\\nto a compliment. I have been complimented myself a great many times, and\\r\\nthey always embarrass me—I always feel that they have not said enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Admiral and myself have held public office, and were associated\\r\\ntogether a great deal in a friendly way in the time of Pocahontas.\\r\\nThat incident where Pocahontas saves the life of Smith from her father,\\r\\nPowhatan’s club, was gotten up by the Admiral and myself to advertise\\r\\nJamestown.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time the Admiral and myself did not have the facilities of\\r\\nadvertising that you have.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have known Admiral Harrington in all kinds of situations—in public\\r\\nservice, on the platform, and in the chain-gang now and then—but it was\\r\\na mistake. A case of mistaken identity. I do not think it is at all a\\r\\nnecessity to tell you Admiral Harrington’s public history. You know that\\r\\nit is in the histories. I am not here to tell you anything about his\\r\\npublic life, but to expose his private life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am something of a poet. When the great poet laureate, Tennyson, died,\\r\\nand I found that the place was open, I tried to get it—but I did not\\r\\nget it. Anybody can write the first line of a poem, but it is a very\\r\\ndifficult task to make the second line rhyme with the first. When I was\\r\\ndown in Australia there were two towns named Johnswood and Par-am. I\\r\\nmade this rhyme:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n               “The people of Johnswood are pious and good;\\r\\n               The people of Par-am they don’t care a----.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not want to compliment Admiral Harrington, but as long as such men\\r\\nas he devote their lives to the public service the credit of the country\\r\\nwill never cease. I will say that the same high qualities, the same\\r\\nmoral and intellectual attainments, the same graciousness of manner, of\\r\\nconduct, of observation, and expression have caused Admiral Harrington\\r\\nto be mistaken for me—and I have been mistaken for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nA mutual compliment can go no further, and I now have the honor and\\r\\nprivilege of introducing to you Admiral Harrington.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOTOS CLUB DINNER IN HONOR OF MARK TWAIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE FIRST FORMAL DINNER IN THE NEW CLUB-HOUSE,\\r\\n          NOVEMBER 11, 1893\\r\\n\\r\\n          In introducing the guest of the evening, Mr. Lawrence said:\\r\\n\\r\\n          “To-night the old faces appear once more amid new surroundings.\\r\\n          The place where last we met about the table has vanished, and\\r\\n          to-night we have our first Lotos dinner in a home that is all\\r\\n          our own.  It is peculiarly fitting that the board should now be\\r\\n          spread in honor of one who has been a member of the club for\\r\\n          full a score of years, and it is a happy augury for the future\\r\\n          that our fellow-member whom we assemble to greet should be the\\r\\n          bearer of a most distinguished name in the world of letters;\\r\\n          for the Lotos Club is ever at its best when paying homage to\\r\\n          genius in literature or in art.  Is there a civilized being who\\r\\n          has not heard the name of Mark Twain?  We knew him long years\\r\\n          ago, before he came out of the boundless West, brimful of wit\\r\\n          and eloquence, with no reverence for anything, and went abroad\\r\\n          to educate the untutored European in the subtleties of the\\r\\n          American joke.  The world has looked on and applauded while he\\r\\n          has broken many images.  He has led us in imagination all over\\r\\n          the globe.  With him as our guide we have traversed alike the\\r\\n          Mississippi and the Sea of Galilee.  At his bidding we have\\r\\n          laughed at a thousand absurdities.  By a laborious process of\\r\\n          reasoning he has convinced us that the Egyptian mummies are\\r\\n          actually dead.  He has held us spellbound upon the plain at the\\r\\n          foot of the great Sphinx, and we have joined him in weeping\\r\\n          bitter tears at the tomb of Adam.  To-night we greet him in the\\r\\n          flesh.  What name is there in literature that can be likened to\\r\\n          his?  Perhaps some of the distinguished gentlemen about this\\r\\n          table can tell us, but I know of none.  Himself his only\\r\\n          parallel!”\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN, AND FELLOW-MEMBERS OF THE LOTOS CLUB,—I have\\r\\nseldom in my lifetime listened to compliments so felicitously phrased\\r\\nor so well deserved. I return thanks for them from a full heart and an\\r\\nappreciative spirit, and I will say this in self-defence: While I am\\r\\ncharged with having no reverence for anything, I wish to say that I have\\r\\nreverence for the man who can utter such truths, and I also have a deep\\r\\nreverence and a sincere one for a club that can do such justice to me.\\r\\nTo be the chief guest of such a club is something to be envied, and if\\r\\nI read your countenances rightly I am envied. I am glad to see this club\\r\\nin such palatial quarters. I remember it twenty years ago when it was\\r\\nhoused in a stable.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when I was studying for the ministry there were two or three things\\r\\nthat struck my attention particularly. At the first banquet mentioned\\r\\nin history that other prodigal son who came back from his travels was\\r\\ninvited to stand up and have his say. They were all there, his brethren,\\r\\nDavid and Goliath, and—er, and if he had had such experience as I have\\r\\nhad he would have waited until those other people got through talking.\\r\\nHe got up and testified to all his failings. Now if he had waited before\\r\\ntelling all about his riotous living until the others had spoken he\\r\\nmight not have given himself away as he did, and I think that I would\\r\\ngive myself away if I should go on. I think I’d better wait until the\\r\\nothers hand in their testimony; then if it is necessary for me to make\\r\\nan explanation, I will get up and explain, and if I cannot do that, I’ll\\r\\ndeny it happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Later in the evening Mr. Clemens made another speech, replying\\r\\n          to a fire of short speeches by Charles Dudley Warner, Charles\\r\\n          A. Dana, Seth Low, General Porter, and many others, each\\r\\n          welcoming the guest of honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t see that I have a great deal to explain. I got off very well,\\r\\nconsidering the opportunities that these other fellows had. I don’t\\r\\nsee that Mr. Low said anything against me, and neither did Mr. Dana.\\r\\nHowever, I will say that I never heard so many lies told in one evening\\r\\nas were told by Mr. McKelway—and I consider myself very capable; but\\r\\neven in his case, when he got through, I was gratified by finding how\\r\\nmuch he hadn’t found out. By accident he missed the very things that I\\r\\ndidn’t want to have said, and now, gentlemen, about Americanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been on the continent of Europe for two and a half years. I have\\r\\nmet many Americans there, some sojourning for a short time only, others\\r\\nmaking protracted stays, and it has been very gratifying to me to find\\r\\nthat nearly all preserved their Americanism. I have found they all like\\r\\nto see the Flag fly, and that their hearts rise when they see the Stars\\r\\nand Stripes. I met only one lady who had forgotten the land of her birth\\r\\nand glorified monarchical institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it is a great thing to say that in two and a half years I met\\r\\nonly one person who had fallen a victim to the shams—I think we may call\\r\\nthem shams—of nobilities and of heredities. She was entirely lost in\\r\\nthem. After I had listened to her for a long time, I said to her:\\r\\n“At least you must admit that we have one merit. We are not like the\\r\\nChinese, who refuse to allow their citizens who are tired of the country\\r\\nto leave it. Thank God, we don’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOPYRIGHT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          With Mr. Howells, Edward Everett Hale, Thomas Nelson Page, and\\r\\n          a number of other authors, Mr. Clemens appeared before the\\r\\n          committee December 6, 1906.  The new Copyright Bill\\r\\n          contemplated an author’s copyright for the term of his life and\\r\\n          for fifty years thereafter, applying also for the benefit of\\r\\n          artists, musicians, and others, but the authors did most of the\\r\\n          talking.  F. D. Millet made a speech for the artists, and John\\r\\n          Philip Sousa for the musicians.\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens was the last speaker of the day, and its chief\\r\\n          feature.  He made a speech, the serious parts of which created\\r\\n          a strong impression, and the humorous parts set the Senators\\r\\n          and Representatives in roars of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have read this bill. At least I have read such portions as I could\\r\\nunderstand. Nobody but a practised legislator can read the bill and\\r\\nthoroughly understand it, and I am not a practised legislator.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am interested particularly and especially in the part of the bill\\r\\nwhich concerns my trade. I like that extension of copyright life to the\\r\\nauthor’s life and fifty years afterward. I think that would satisfy any\\r\\nreasonable author, because it would take care of his children. Let\\r\\nthe grandchildren take care of themselves. That would take care of my\\r\\ndaughters, and after that I am not particular. I shall then have long\\r\\nbeen out of this struggle, independent of it, indifferent to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt isn’t objectionable to me that all the trades and professions in\\r\\nthe United States are protected by the bill. I like that. They are\\r\\nall important and worthy, and if we can take care of them under the\\r\\nCopyright law I should like to see it done. I should like to see oyster\\r\\nculture added, and anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am aware that copyright must have a limit, because that is required\\r\\nby the Constitution of the United States, which sets aside the earlier\\r\\nConstitution, which we call the decalogue. The decalogue says you shall\\r\\nnot take away from any man his profit. I don’t like to be obliged to\\r\\nuse the harsh term. What the decalogue really says is, “Thou shalt not\\r\\nsteal,” but I am trying to use more polite language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe laws of England and America do take it away, do select but one\\r\\nclass, the people who create the literature of the land. They always\\r\\ntalk handsomely about the literature of the land, always what a fine,\\r\\ngreat, monumental thing a great literature is, and in the midst of their\\r\\nenthusiasm they turn around and do what they can to discourage it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know we must have a limit, but forty-two years is too much of a limit.\\r\\nI am quite unable to guess why there should be a limit at all to the\\r\\npossession of the product of a man’s labor. There is no limit to real\\r\\nestate.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoctor Hale has suggested that a man might just as well, after\\r\\ndiscovering a coal-mine and working it forty-two years, have the\\r\\nGovernment step in and take it away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the excuse? It is that the author who produced that book has\\r\\nhad the profit of it long enough, and therefore the Government takes\\r\\na profit which does not belong to it and generously gives it to the\\r\\n88,000,000 of people. But it doesn’t do anything of the kind. It merely\\r\\ntakes the author’s property, takes his children’s bread, and gives the\\r\\npublisher double profit. He goes on publishing the book and as many of\\r\\nhis confederates as choose to go into the conspiracy do so, and they\\r\\nrear families in affluence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they continue the enjoyment of those ill-gotten gains generation\\r\\nafter generation forever, for they never die. In a few weeks or months\\r\\nor years I shall be out of it, I hope under a monument. I hope I shall\\r\\nnot be entirely forgotten, and I shall subscribe to the monument myself.\\r\\nBut I shall not be caring what happens if there are fifty years left of\\r\\nmy copyright. My copyright produces annually a good deal more than I\\r\\ncan use, but my children can use it. I can get along; I know a lot of\\r\\ntrades. But that goes to my daughters, who can’t get along as well as I\\r\\ncan because I have carefully raised them as young ladies, who don’t know\\r\\nanything and can’t do anything. I hope Congress will extend to them the\\r\\ncharity which they have failed to get from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, if a man who is not even mad, but only strenuous—strenuous about\\r\\nrace-suicide—should come to me and try to get me to use my large\\r\\npolitical and ecclesiastical influence to get a bill passed by this\\r\\nCongress limiting families to twenty-two children by one mother, I\\r\\nshould try to calm him down. I should reason with him. I should say to\\r\\nhim, “Leave it alone. Leave it alone and it will take care of itself.\\r\\nOnly one couple a year in the United States can reach that limit. If\\r\\nthey have reached that limit let them go right on. Let them have all the\\r\\nliberty they want. In restricting that family to twenty-two children you\\r\\nare merely conferring discomfort and unhappiness on one family per year\\r\\nin a nation of 88,000,000, which is not worth while.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the very same with copyright. One author per year produces a book\\r\\nwhich can outlive the forty-two-year limit; that’s all. This nation\\r\\ncan’t produce two authors a year that can do it; the thing is\\r\\ndemonstrably impossible. All that the limited copyright can do is to\\r\\ntake the bread out of the mouths of the children of that one author per\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made an estimate some years ago, when I appeared before a committee\\r\\nof the House of Lords, that we had published in this country since the\\r\\nDeclaration of Independence 220,000 books. They have all gone. They had\\r\\nall perished before they were ten years old. It is only one book in 1000\\r\\nthat can outlive the forty-two year limit. Therefore why put a limit at\\r\\nall? You might as well limit the family to twenty-two children.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you recall the Americans in the nineteenth century who wrote books\\r\\nthat lived forty-two years you will have to begin with Cooper; you can\\r\\nfollow with Washington Irving, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Edgar Allan Poe,\\r\\nand there you have to wait a long time. You come to Emerson, and\\r\\nyou have to stand still and look further. You find Howells and T.\\r\\nB. Aldrich, and then your numbers begin to run pretty thin, and you\\r\\nquestion if you can name twenty persons in the United States who—in a\\r\\nwhole century have written books that would live forty-two years. Why,\\r\\nyou could take them all and put them on one bench there [pointing]. Add\\r\\nthe wives and children and you could put the result on, two or three\\r\\nmore benches.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne hundred persons—that is the little, insignificant crowd whose\\r\\nbread-and-butter is to be taken away for what purpose, for what profit\\r\\nto anybody? You turn these few books into the hands of the pirate and of\\r\\nthe legitimate publisher, too, and they get the profit that should have\\r\\ngone to the wife and children.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I appeared before that committee of the House of Lords the chairman\\r\\nasked me what limit I would propose. I said, “Perpetuity.” I could see\\r\\nsome resentment in his manner, and he said the idea was illogical, for\\r\\nthe reason that it has long ago been decided that there can be no such\\r\\nthing as property in ideas. I said there was property in ideas before\\r\\nQueen Anne’s time; they had perpetual copyright. He said, “What is a\\r\\nbook? A book is just built from base to roof on ideas, and there can be\\r\\nno property in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI said I wished he could mention any kind of property on this planet\\r\\nthat had a pecuniary value which was not derived from an idea or ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said real estate. I put a supposititious case, a dozen Englishmen who\\r\\ntravel through South Africa and camp out, and eleven of them see nothing\\r\\nat all; they are mentally blind. But there is one in the party who knows\\r\\nwhat this harbor means and what the lay of the land means. To him it\\r\\nmeans that some day a railway will go through here, and there on that\\r\\nharbor a great city will spring up. That is his idea. And he has another\\r\\nidea, which is to go and trade his last bottle of Scotch whiskey and his\\r\\nlast horse-blanket to the principal chief of that region and buy a piece\\r\\nof land the size of Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the value of an idea that the day would come when the Cape to\\r\\nCairo Railway would be built.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery improvement that is put upon the real estate is the result of an\\r\\nidea in somebody’s head. The skyscraper is another idea; the railroad\\r\\nis another; the telephone and all those things are merely symbols which\\r\\nrepresent ideas. An andiron, a wash-tub, is the result of an idea that\\r\\ndid not exist before.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo if, as that gentleman said, a book does consist solely of ideas, that\\r\\nis the best argument in the world that it is property, and should not be\\r\\nunder any limitation at all. We don’t ask for that. Fifty years from now\\r\\nwe shall ask for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope the bill will pass without any deleterious amendments. I do seem\\r\\nto be extraordinarily interested in a whole lot of arts and things that\\r\\nI have got nothing to do with. It is a part of my generous, liberal\\r\\nnature; I can’t help it. I feel the same sort of charity to everybody\\r\\nthat was manifested by a gentleman who arrived at home at two o’clock\\r\\nin the morning from the club and was feeling so perfectly satisfied with\\r\\nlife, so happy, and so comfortable, and there was his house weaving,\\r\\nweaving, weaving around. He watched his chance, and by and by when the\\r\\nsteps got in his neighborhood he made a jump and climbed up and got on\\r\\nthe portico.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the house went on weaving and weaving and weaving, but he watched\\r\\nthe door, and when it came around his way he plunged through it. He\\r\\ngot to the stairs, and when he went up on all fours the house was so\\r\\nunsteady that he could hardly make his way, but at last he got to the\\r\\ntop and raised his foot and put it on the top step. But only the toe\\r\\nhitched on the step, and he rolled down and fetched up on the bottom\\r\\nstep, with his arm around the newel-post, and he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“God pity the poor sailors out at sea on a night like this.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIN AID OF THE BLIND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE NEW YORK ASSOCIATION FOR\\r\\n          PROMOTING THE INTERESTS OF THE BLIND AT THE WALDORF ASTORIA,\\r\\n          MARCH 29, 1906\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you detect any awkwardness in my movements and infelicities in my\\r\\nconduct I will offer the explanation that I never presided at a meeting\\r\\nof any kind before in my life, and that I do find it out of my line. I\\r\\nsupposed I could do anything anybody else could, but I recognize that\\r\\nexperience helps, and I do feel the lack of that experience. I don’t\\r\\nfeel as graceful and easy as I ought to be in order to impress an\\r\\naudience. I shall not pretend that I know how to umpire a meeting like\\r\\nthis, and I shall just take the humble place of the Essex band.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a great gathering in a small New England town, about\\r\\ntwenty-five years ago. I remember that circumstance because there was\\r\\nsomething that happened at that time. It was a great occasion. They\\r\\ngathered in the militia and orators and everybody from all the towns\\r\\naround. It was an extraordinary occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little local paper threw itself into ecstasies of admiration and\\r\\ntried to do itself proud from beginning to end. It praised the orators,\\r\\nthe militia, and all the bands that came from everywhere, and all this\\r\\nin honest country newspaper detail, but the writer ran out of adjectives\\r\\ntoward the end. Having exhausted his whole magazine of praise and\\r\\nglorification, he found he still had one band left over. He had to\\r\\nsay something about it, and he said: “The Essex band done the best it\\r\\ncould.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI am an Essex band on this occasion, and I am going to get through as\\r\\nwell as inexperience and good intentions will enable me. I have got\\r\\nall the documents here necessary to instruct you in the objects and\\r\\nintentions of this meeting and also of the association which has\\r\\ncalled the meeting. But they are too voluminous. I could not pack those\\r\\nstatistics into my head, and I had to give it up. I shall have to just\\r\\nreduce all that mass of statistics to a few salient facts. There are\\r\\ntoo many statistics and figures for me. I never could do anything\\r\\nwith figures, never had any talent for mathematics, never accomplished\\r\\nanything in my efforts at that rugged study, and to-day the only\\r\\nmathematics I know is multiplication, and the minute I get away up in\\r\\nthat, as soon as I reach nine times seven—\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mr. Clemens lapsed into deep thought for a moment. He was trying to\\r\\nfigure out nine times seven, but it was a hopeless task, and he turned\\r\\nto St. Clair McKelway, who sat near him. Mr. McKelway whispered the\\r\\nanswer, and the speaker resumed:]\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve got it now. It’s eighty-four. Well, I can get that far all right\\r\\nwith a little hesitation. After that I am uncertain, and I can’t manage\\r\\na statistic.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This association for the—”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mr. Clemens was in another dilemma. Again he was obliged to turn to Mr.\\r\\nMcKelway.]\\r\\n\\r\\nOh yes, for promoting the interests of the blind. It’s a long name. If\\r\\nI could I would write it out for you and let you take it home and\\r\\nstudy it, but I don’t know how to spell it. And Mr. Carnegie is down in\\r\\nVirginia somewhere. Well, anyway, the object of that association which\\r\\nhas been recently organized, five months ago, in fact, is in the hands\\r\\nof very, very energetic, intelligent, and capable people, and they will\\r\\npush it to success very surely, and all the more surely if you will give\\r\\nthem a little of your assistance out of your pockets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intention, the purpose, is to search out all the blind and find work\\r\\nfor them to do so that they may earn, their own bread. Now it is dismal\\r\\nenough to be blind—it is dreary, dreary life at best, but it can be\\r\\nlargely ameliorated by finding something for these poor blind people to\\r\\ndo with their hands. The time passes so heavily that it is never day\\r\\nor night with them, it is always night, and when they have to sit with\\r\\nfolded hands and with nothing to do to amuse or entertain or employ\\r\\ntheir minds, it is drearier and drearier.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the knowledge they have that they must subsist on charity, and\\r\\nso often reluctant charity, it would renew their lives if they could\\r\\nhave something to do with their hands and pass their time and at the\\r\\nsame time earn their bread, and know the sweetness of the bread which\\r\\nis the result of the labor of one’s own hands. They need that cheer and\\r\\npleasure. It is the only way you can turn their night into day, to\\r\\ngive them happy hearts, the only thing you can put in the place of the\\r\\nblessed sun. That you can do in the way I speak of.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlind people generally who have seen the light know what it is to\\r\\nmiss the light. Those who have gone blind since they were twenty years\\r\\nold—their lives are unendingly dreary. But they can be taught to use\\r\\ntheir hands and to employ themselves at a great many industries. That\\r\\nassociation from which this draws its birth in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\\r\\nhas taught its blind to make many things. They make them better than\\r\\nmost people, and more honest than people who have the use of their eyes.\\r\\nThe goods they make are readily salable. People like them. And so they\\r\\nare supporting themselves, and it is a matter of cheer, cheer. They pass\\r\\ntheir time now not too irksomely as they formerly did.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat this association needs and wants is $15,000. The figures are set\\r\\ndown, and what the money is for, and there is no graft in it or I would\\r\\nnot be here. And they hope to beguile that out of your pockets, and you\\r\\nwill find affixed to the programme an opportunity, that little blank\\r\\nwhich you will fill out and promise so much money now or to-morrow or\\r\\nsome time. Then, there is another opportunity which is still better, and\\r\\nthat is that you shall subscribe an annual sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have invented a good many useful things in my time, but never anything\\r\\nbetter than that of getting money out of people who don’t want to part\\r\\nwith it. It is always for good objects, of course. This is the plan:\\r\\nWhen you call upon a person to contribute to a great and good object,\\r\\nand you think he should furnish about $1,000, he disappoints you as like\\r\\nas not. Much the best way to work him to supply that thousand dollars is\\r\\nto split it into parts and contribute, say a hundred dollars a year,\\r\\nor fifty, or whatever the sum maybe. Let him contribute ten or twenty a\\r\\nyear. He doesn’t feel that, but he does feel it when you call upon him\\r\\nto contribute a large amount. When you get used to it you would rather\\r\\ncontribute than borrow money.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried it in Helen Keller’s case. Mr. Hutton wrote me in 1896 or 1897\\r\\nwhen I was in London and said: “The gentleman who has been so liberal in\\r\\ntaking care of Helen Keller has died without making provision for her\\r\\nin his will, and now they don’t know what to do.” They were proposing\\r\\nto raise a fund, and he thought $50,000 enough to furnish an income of\\r\\n$2400 or $2500 a year for the support of that wonderful girl and her\\r\\nwonderful teacher, Miss Sullivan, now Mrs. Macy. I wrote to Mr. Hutton\\r\\nand said: “Go on, get up your fund. It will be slow, but if you want\\r\\nquick work, I propose this system,” the system I speak of, of asking\\r\\npeople to contribute such and such a sum from year to year and drop\\r\\nout whenever they please, and he would find there wouldn’t be any\\r\\ndifficulty, people wouldn’t feel the burden of it. And he wrote back\\r\\nsaying he had raised the $2400 a year indefinitely by that system in a\\r\\nsingle afternoon. We would like to do something just like that to-night.\\r\\nWe will take as many checks as you care to give. You can leave your\\r\\ndonations in the big room outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew once what it was to be blind. I shall never forget that\\r\\nexperience. I have been as blind as anybody ever was for three or\\r\\nfour hours, and the sufferings that I endured and the mishaps and the\\r\\naccidents that are burning in my memory make my sympathy rise when I\\r\\nfeel for the blind and always shall feel. I once went to Heidelberg\\r\\non an excursion. I took a clergyman along with me, the Rev. Joseph\\r\\nTwichell, of Hartford, who is still among the living despite that fact.\\r\\nI always travel with clergymen when I can. It is better for them, it is\\r\\nbetter for me. And any preacher who goes out with me in stormy weather\\r\\nand without a lightning rod is a good one. The Reverend Twichell is one\\r\\nof those people filled with patience and endurance, two good ingredients\\r\\nfor a man travelling with me, so we got along very well together. In\\r\\nthat old town they have not altered a house nor built one in 1500 years.\\r\\nWe went to the inn and they placed Twichell and me in a most colossal\\r\\nbedroom, the largest I ever saw or heard of. It was as big as this room.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t take much notice of the place. I didn’t really get my bearings.\\r\\nI noticed Twichell got a German bed about two feet wide, the kind in\\r\\nwhich you’ve got to lie on your edge, because there isn’t room to lie on\\r\\nyour back, and he was way down south in that big room, and I was way up\\r\\nnorth at the other end of it, with a regular Sahara in between.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went to bed. Twichell went to sleep, but then he had his conscience\\r\\nloaded and it was easy for him to get to sleep. I couldn’t get to sleep.\\r\\nIt was one of those torturing kinds of lovely summer nights when you\\r\\nhear various kinds of noises now and then. A mouse away off in the\\r\\nsouthwest. You throw things at the mouse. That encourages the mouse. But\\r\\nI couldn’t stand it, and about two o’clock I got up and thought I\\r\\nwould give it up and go out in the square where there was one of those\\r\\ntinkling fountains, and sit on its brink and dream, full of romance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got out of bed, and I ought to have lit a candle, but I didn’t think\\r\\nof it until it was too late. It was the darkest place that ever was.\\r\\nThere has never been darkness any thicker than that. It just lay in\\r\\ncakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought that before dressing I would accumulate my clothes. I pawed\\r\\naround in the dark and found everything packed together on the floor\\r\\nexcept one sock. I couldn’t get on the track of that sock. It might\\r\\nhave occurred to me that maybe it was in the wash. But I didn’t think of\\r\\nthat. I went excursioning on my hands and knees. Presently I thought,\\r\\n“I am never going to find it; I’ll go back to bed again.” That is what I\\r\\ntried to do during the next three hours. I had lost the bearings of that\\r\\nbed. I was going in the wrong direction all the time. By-and-by I came\\r\\nin collision with a chair and that encouraged me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed to me, as far as I could recollect, there was only a chair\\r\\nhere and there and yonder, five or six of them scattered over this\\r\\nterritory, and I thought maybe after I found that chair I might find the\\r\\nnext one. Well, I did. And I found another and another and another. I\\r\\nkept going around on my hands and knees, having those sudden collisions,\\r\\nand finally when I banged into another chair I almost lost my temper.\\r\\nAnd I raised up, garbed as I was, not for public exhibition, right in\\r\\nfront of a mirror fifteen or sixteen feet high.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hadn’t noticed the mirror; didn’t know it was there. And when I saw\\r\\nmyself in the mirror I was frightened out of my wits. I don’t allow any\\r\\nghosts to bite me, and I took up a chair and smashed at it. A million\\r\\npieces. Then I reflected. That’s the way I always do, and it’s\\r\\nunprofitable unless a man has had much experience that way and has\\r\\nclear judgment. And I had judgment, and I would have had to pay for that\\r\\nmirror if I hadn’t recollected to say it was Twichell who broke it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I got down, on my hands and knees and went on another exploring\\r\\nexpedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as I could remember there were six chairs in that Oklahoma, and\\r\\none table, a great big heavy table, not a good table to hit with your\\r\\nhead when rushing madly along. In the course of time I collided with\\r\\nthirty-five chairs and tables enough to stock that dining-room out\\r\\nthere. It was a hospital for decayed furniture, and it was in a worse\\r\\ncondition when I got through with it. I went on and on, and at last got\\r\\nto a place where I could feel my way up, and there was a shelf. I knew\\r\\nthat wasn’t in the middle of the room. Up to that time I was afraid I\\r\\nhad gotten out of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very careful and pawed along that shelf, and there was a pitcher\\r\\nof water about a foot high, and it was at the head of Twichell’s bed,\\r\\nbut I didn’t know it. I felt that pitcher going and I grabbed at it,\\r\\nbut it didn’t help any and came right down in Twichell’s face and nearly\\r\\ndrowned him. But it woke him up. I was grateful to have company on any\\r\\nterms. He lit a match, and there I was, way down south when I ought to\\r\\nhave been back up yonder. My bed was out of sight it was so far away.\\r\\nYou needed a telescope to find it. Twichell comforted me and I scrubbed\\r\\nhim off and we got sociable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that night wasn’t wasted. I had my pedometer on my leg. Twichell and\\r\\nI were in a pedometer match. Twichell had longer legs than I. The only\\r\\nway I could keep up was to wear my pedometer to bed. I always walk in my\\r\\nsleep, and on this occasion I gained sixteen miles on him. After all, I\\r\\nnever found that sock. I never have seen it from that day to this. But\\r\\nthat adventure taught me what it is to be blind. That was one of the\\r\\nmost serious occasions of my whole life, yet I never can speak of it\\r\\nwithout somebody thinking it isn’t serious. You try it and see how\\r\\nserious it is to be as the blind are and I was that night.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mr. Clemens read several letters of regret. He then introduced Joseph\\r\\nH. Choate, saying:]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is now my privilege to present to you Mr. Choate. I don’t have to\\r\\nreally introduce him. I don’t have to praise him, or to flatter him.\\r\\nI could say truly that in the forty-seven years I have been familiarly\\r\\nacquainted with him he has always been the handsomest man America has\\r\\never produced. And I hope and believe he will hold the belt forty-five\\r\\nyears more. He has served his country ably, faithfully, and brilliantly.\\r\\nHe stands at the summit, at the very top in the esteem and regard of his\\r\\ncountrymen, and if I could say one word which would lift him any higher\\r\\nin his countrymen’s esteem and affection, I would say that word whether\\r\\nit was true or not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDR. MARK TWAIN, FARMEOPATH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE ANNUAL DINNER OF THE NEW YORK POST-GRADUATE\\r\\n          MEDICAL SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL, JANUARY 21, 1909\\r\\n\\r\\n          The president, Dr.  George N.  Miller, in introducing Mr.\\r\\n          Clemens, referred to his late experience with burglars.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMEN AND DOCTORS,—I am glad to be among my own kind to-night. I\\r\\nwas once a sharpshooter, but now I practise a much higher and equally as\\r\\ndeadly a profession. It wasn’t so very long ago that I became a member\\r\\nof your cult, and for the time I’ve been in the business my record is\\r\\none that can’t be scoffed at.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the burglars, I am perfectly familiar with these people. I have\\r\\nalways had a good deal to do with burglars—not officially, but through\\r\\ntheir attentions to me. I never suffered anything at the hands of a\\r\\nburglar. They have invaded my house time and time again. They never got\\r\\nanything. Then those people who burglarized our house in September—we\\r\\ngot back the plated ware they took off, we jailed them, and I have been\\r\\nsorry ever since. They did us a great service they scared off all the\\r\\nservants in the place.\\r\\n\\r\\nI consider the Children’s Theatre, of which I am president, and the\\r\\nPost-Graduate Medical School as the two greatest institutions in the\\r\\ncountry. This school, in bringing its twenty thousand physicians from\\r\\nall parts of the country, bringing them up to date, and sending them\\r\\nback with renewed confidence, has surely saved hundreds of thousands of\\r\\nlives which otherwise would have been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been practising now for seven months. When I settled on my farm\\r\\nin Connecticut in June I found the Community very thinly settled—and\\r\\nsince I have been engaged in practice it has become more thinly settled\\r\\nstill. This gratifies me, as indicating that I am making an impression\\r\\non my community. I suppose it is the same with all of you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have always felt that I ought to do something for you, and so I\\r\\norganized a Redding (Connecticut) branch of the Post-Graduate School. I\\r\\nam only a country farmer up there, but I am doing the best I can.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the practice of medicine and surgery in a remote country\\r\\ndistrict has its disadvantages, but in my case I am happy in a division\\r\\nof responsibility. I practise in conjunction with a horse-doctor, a\\r\\nsexton, and an undertaker. The combination is air-tight, and once a man\\r\\nis stricken in our district escape is impossible for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese four of us—three in the regular profession and the fourth an\\r\\nundertaker—are all good men. There is Bill Ferguson, the Redding\\r\\nundertaker. Bill is there in every respect. He is a little lukewarm on\\r\\ngeneral practice, and writes his name with a rubber stamp. Like my old\\r\\nSouthern, friend, he is one of the finest planters anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there is Jim Ruggles, the horse-doctor. Ruggles is one of the best\\r\\nmen I have got. He also is not much on general medicine, but he is a\\r\\nfine horse-doctor. Ferguson doesn’t make any money off him.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see, the combination started this way. When I got up to Redding and\\r\\nhad become a doctor, I looked around to see what my chances were for\\r\\naiding in the great work. The first thing I did was to determine what\\r\\nmanner of doctor I was to be. Being a Connecticut farmer, I naturally\\r\\nconsulted my farmacopia, and at once decided to become a farmeopath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I got circulating about, and got in touch with Ferguson and\\r\\nRuggles. Ferguson joined readily in my ideas, but Ruggles kept saying\\r\\nthat, while it was all right for an undertaker to get aboard, he\\r\\ncouldn’t see where it helped horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, we started to find out what was the trouble with the community,\\r\\nand it didn’t take long to find out that there was just one disease, and\\r\\nthat was race-suicide. And driving about the country-side I was told\\r\\nby my fellow-farmers that it was the only rational human and valuable\\r\\ndisease. But it is cutting into our profits so that we’ll either have to\\r\\nstop it or we’ll have to move.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve had some funny experiences up there in Redding. Not long ago a\\r\\nfellow came along with a rolling gait and a distressed face. We asked\\r\\nhim what was the matter. We always hold consultations on every case, as\\r\\nthere isn’t business enough for four. He said he didn’t know, but that\\r\\nhe was a sailor, and perhaps that might help us to give a diagnosis. We\\r\\ntreated him for that, and I never saw a man die more peacefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat same afternoon my dog Tige treed an African gentleman. We\\r\\nchained up the dog, and then the gentleman came down and said he had\\r\\nappendicitis. We asked him if he wanted to be cut open, and he said yes,\\r\\nthat he’d like to know if there was anything in it. So we cut him open\\r\\nand found nothing in him but darkness. So we diagnosed his case as\\r\\ninfidelity, because he was dark inside. Tige is a very clever dog, and\\r\\naids us greatly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other day a patient came to me and inquired if I was old Doctor\\r\\nClemens—\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a practitioner I have given a great deal of my attention to Bright’s\\r\\ndisease. I have made some rules for treating it that may be valuable.\\r\\nListen:\\r\\n\\r\\nRule 1. When approaching the bedside of one whom an all-wise President—I\\r\\nmean an all-wise Providence—well, anyway, it’s the same thing—has seen\\r\\nfit to afflict with disease—well, the rule is simple, even if it is\\r\\nold-fashioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nRule 2. I’ve forgotten just what it is, but—\\r\\n\\r\\nRule 3. This is always indispensable: Bleed your patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMISSOURI UNIVERSITY SPEECH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS DELIVERED JUNE 4, 1902, AT COLUMBIA, MO.\\r\\n\\r\\n          When the name of Samuel L. Clemens was called the humorist\\r\\n          stepped forward, put his hand to his hair, and apparently\\r\\n          hesitated.  There was a dead silence for a moment.  Suddenly\\r\\n          the entire audience rose and stood in silence.  Some one began\\r\\n          to spell out the word Missouri with an interval between the\\r\\n          letters.  All joined in.  Then the house again became silent.\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens broke the spell:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you are all standing [he drawled in his characteristic voice], I\\r\\nguess, I suppose I had better stand too.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Then came a laugh and loud cries for a speech. As the great humorist\\r\\nspoke of his recent visit to Hannibal, his old home, his voice\\r\\ntrembled.]\\r\\n\\r\\nYou cannot know what a strain it was on my emotions [he said]. In fact,\\r\\nwhen I found myself shaking hands with persons I had not seen for fifty\\r\\nyears and looking into wrinkled faces that were so young and joyous when\\r\\nI last saw them, I experienced emotions that I had never expected, and\\r\\ndid not know were in me. I was profoundly moved and saddened to think\\r\\nthat this was the last time, perhaps, that I would ever behold those\\r\\nkind old faces and dear old scenes of childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The humorist then changed to a lighter mood, and for a time the\\r\\naudience was in a continual roar of laughter. He was particularly amused\\r\\nat the eulogy on himself read by Gardiner Lathrop in conferring the\\r\\ndegree.] He has a fine opportunity to distinguish himself [said Mr.\\r\\nClemens] by telling the truth about me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have seen it stated in print that as a boy I had been guilty of\\r\\nstealing peaches, apples, and watermelons. I read a story to this effect\\r\\nvery closely not long ago, and I was convinced of one thing, which was\\r\\nthat the man who wrote it was of the opinion that it was wrong to steal,\\r\\nand that I had not acted right in doing so. I wish now, however, to make\\r\\nan honest statement, which is that I do not believe, in all my checkered\\r\\ncareer, I stole a ton of peaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night I stole—I mean I removed—a watermelon from a wagon while the\\r\\nowner was attending to another customer. I crawled off to a secluded\\r\\nspot, where I found that it was green. It was the greenest melon in\\r\\nthe Mississippi Valley. Then I began to reflect. I began to be sorry. I\\r\\nwondered what George Washington would have done had he been in my place.\\r\\nI thought a long time, and then suddenly felt that strange feeling which\\r\\ncomes to a man with a good resolution, and I took up that watermelon and\\r\\ntook it back to its owner. I handed him the watermelon and told him to\\r\\nreform. He took my lecture much to heart, and, when he gave me a good\\r\\none in place of the green melon, I forgave him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him that I would still be a customer of his, and that I cherished\\r\\nno ill-feeling because of the incident—that would remain green in my\\r\\nmemory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBUSINESS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          The alumni of Eastman College gave their annual banquet,\\r\\n          March 30, 1901, at the Y. M. C. A. Building. Mr. James G.\\r\\n          Cannon, of the Fourth National Bank, made the first speech of\\r\\n          the evening, after which Mr. Clemens was introduced by Mr.\\r\\n          Bailey as the personal friend of Tom Sawyer, who was one of the\\r\\n          types of successful business men.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CANNON has furnished me with texts enough to last as slow a speaker\\r\\nas myself all the rest of the night. I took exception to the introducing\\r\\nof Mr. Cannon as a great financier, as if he were the only great\\r\\nfinancier present. I am a financier. But my methods are not the same as\\r\\nMr. Cannon’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot say that I have turned out the great business man that I\\r\\nthought I was when I began life. But I am comparatively young yet, and\\r\\nmay learn. I am rather inclined to believe that what troubled me was\\r\\nthat I got the big-head early in the game. I want to explain to you a\\r\\nfew points of difference between the principles of business as I see\\r\\nthem and those that Mr. Cannon believes in.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe says that the primary rule of business success is loyalty to your\\r\\nemployer. That’s all right—as a theory. What is the matter with loyalty\\r\\nto yourself? As nearly as I can understand Mr. Cannon’s methods, there\\r\\nis one great drawback to them. He wants you to work a great deal.\\r\\nDiligence is a good thing, but taking things easy is much more-restful.\\r\\nMy idea is that the employer should be the busy man, and the employee\\r\\nthe idle one. The employer should be the worried man, and the employee\\r\\nthe happy one. And why not? He gets the salary. My plan is to get\\r\\nanother man to do the work for me. In that there’s more repose. What I\\r\\nwant is repose first, last, and all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Cannon says that there are three cardinal rules of business success;\\r\\nthey are diligence, honesty, and truthfulness. Well, diligence is all\\r\\nright. Let it go as a theory. Honesty is the best policy—when there is\\r\\nmoney in it. But truthfulness is one of the most dangerous—why, this man\\r\\nis misleading you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had an experience to-day with my wife which illustrates this. I was\\r\\nacknowledging a belated invitation to another dinner for this evening,\\r\\nwhich seemed to have been sent about ten days ago. It only reached me\\r\\nthis morning. I was mortified at the discourtesy into which I had been\\r\\nbrought by this delay, and wondered what was being thought of me by\\r\\nmy hosts. As I had accepted your invitation, of course I had to send\\r\\nregrets to my other friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I started to write this note my wife came up and stood looking\\r\\nover my shoulder. Women always want to know what is going on. Said she\\r\\n“Should not that read in the third person?” I conceded that it should,\\r\\nput aside what I was writing, and commenced over again. That seemed to\\r\\nsatisfy her, and so she sat down and let me proceed. I then—finished my\\r\\nfirst note—and so sent what I intended. I never could have done this if\\r\\nI had let my wife know the truth about it. Here is what I wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     TO THE OHIO SOCIETY,--I have at this moment received a most kind\\r\\n     invitation (eleven days old) from Mr. Southard, president; and a\\r\\n     like one (ten days old) from Mr. Bryant, president of the Press\\r\\n     Club.  I thank the society cordially for the compliment of these\\r\\n     invitations, although I am booked elsewhere and cannot come.\\r\\n\\r\\n     But, oh, I should like to know the name of the Lightning Express by\\r\\n     which they were forwarded; for I owe a friend a dozen chickens, and\\r\\n     I believe it will be cheaper to send eggs instead, and let them\\r\\n     develop on the road.\\r\\n                    Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                                        Mark TWAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to tell you of some of my experiences in business, and then I\\r\\nwill be in a position to lay down one general rule for the guidance\\r\\nof those who want to succeed in business. My first effort was about\\r\\ntwenty-five years ago. I took hold of an invention—I don’t know now\\r\\nwhat it was all about, but some one came to me and told me it was a good\\r\\nthing, and that there was lots of money in it. He persuaded me to invest\\r\\n$15,000, and I lived up to my beliefs by engaging a man to develop it.\\r\\nTo make a long story short, I sunk $40,000 in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I took up the publication of a book. I called in a publisher and\\r\\nsaid to him: “I want you to publish this book along lines which I shall\\r\\nlay down. I am the employer, and you are the employee. I am going to\\r\\nshow them some new kinks in the publishing business. And I want you to\\r\\ndraw on me for money as you go along,” which he did. He drew on me\\r\\nfor $56,000. Then I asked him to take the book and call it off. But he\\r\\nrefused to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy next venture was with a machine for doing something or other. I knew\\r\\nless about that than I did about the invention. But I sunk $170,000 in\\r\\nthe business, and I can’t for the life of me recollect what it was the\\r\\nmachine was to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was still undismayed. You see, one of the strong points about my\\r\\nbusiness life was that I never gave up. I undertook to publish General\\r\\nGrant’s book, and made $140,000 in six months. My axiom is, to succeed\\r\\nin business: avoid my example.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARNEGIE THE BENEFACTOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          At the dinner given in honor of Andrew Carnegie by the Lotos\\r\\n          Club, March 17, 1909, Mr. Clemens appeared in a white suit from\\r\\n          head to feet.  He wore a white double-breasted coat, white\\r\\n          trousers, and white shoes.  The only relief was a big black\\r\\n          cigar, which he confidentially informed the company was not\\r\\n          from his usual stack bought at $3 per barrel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe State of Missouri has for its coat of arms a barrel-head with two\\r\\nMissourians, one on each side of it, and mark the motto—“United We\\r\\nStand, Divided We Fall.” Mr. Carnegie, this evening, has suffered from\\r\\ncompliments. It is interesting to hear what people will say about a man.\\r\\nWhy, at the banquet given by this club in my honor, Mr. Carnegie had\\r\\nthe inspiration for which the club is now honoring him. If Dunfermline\\r\\ncontributed so much to the United States in contributing Mr. Carnegie,\\r\\nwhat would have happened if all Scotland had turned out? These\\r\\nDunfermline folk have acquired advantages in coming to America.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoctor McKelway paid the top compliment, the cumulation, when he said of\\r\\nMr. Carnegie:\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is a man who wants to pay more taxes than he is charged.” Richard\\r\\nWatson Gilder did very well for a poet. He advertised his magazine. He\\r\\nspoke of hiring Mr. Carnegie—the next thing he will be trying to hire\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I undertook to pay compliments I would do it stronger than any others\\r\\nhave done it, for what Mr. Carnegie wants are strong compliments. Now,\\r\\nthe other side of seventy, I have preserved, as my chiefest virtue,\\r\\nmodesty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nON POETRY, VERACITY, AND SUICIDE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT A DINNER OF THE MANHATTAN DICKENS FELLOWSHIP,\\r\\n          NEW YORK CITY, FEBRUARY 7, 1906\\r\\n\\r\\n          This dinner was in commemoration of the ninety-fourth\\r\\n          anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens.  On an other\\r\\n          occasion Mr. Clemens told the same story with variations and a\\r\\n          different conclusion to the University Settlement Society.\\r\\n\\r\\nI always had taken an interest in young people who wanted to become\\r\\npoets. I remember I was particularly interested in one budding poet when\\r\\nI was a reporter. His name was Butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he came to me and said, disconsolately, that he was going to\\r\\ncommit suicide—he was tired of life, not being able to express his\\r\\nthoughts in poetic form. Butter asked me what I thought of the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said I would; that it was a good idea. “You can do me a friendly turn.\\r\\nYou go off in a private place and do it there, and I’ll get it all. You\\r\\ndo it, and I’ll do as much for you some time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first he determined to drown himself. Drowning is so nice and clean,\\r\\nand writes up so well in a newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut things ne’er do go smoothly in weddings, suicides, or courtships.\\r\\nOnly there at the edge of the water, where Butter was to end himself,\\r\\nlay a life-preserver—a big round canvas one, which would float after the\\r\\nscrap-iron was soaked out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nButter wouldn’t kill himself with the life-preserver in sight, and so\\r\\nI had an idea. I took it to a pawnshop, and [soaked] it for a revolver:\\r\\nThe pawnbroker didn’t think much of the exchange, but when I explained\\r\\nthe situation he acquiesced. We went up on top of a high building, and\\r\\nthis is what happened to the poet:\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put the revolver to his forehead and blew a tunnel straight through\\r\\nhis head. The tunnel was about the size of your finger. You could look\\r\\nright through it. The job was complete; there was nothing in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, after that that man never could write prose, but he could write\\r\\npoetry. He could write it after he had blown his brains out. There is\\r\\nlots of that talent all over the country, but the trouble is they don’t\\r\\ndevelop it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am suffering now from the fact that I, who have told the truth a good\\r\\nmany times in my life, have lately received more letters than anybody\\r\\nelse urging me to lead a righteous life. I have more friends who want to\\r\\nsee me develop on a high level than anybody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung John D. Rockefeller, two weeks ago, taught his Bible class all\\r\\nabout veracity, and why it was better that everybody should always keep\\r\\na plentiful supply on hand. Some of the letters I have received suggest\\r\\nthat I ought to attend his class and learn, too. Why, I know Mr.\\r\\nRockefeller, and he is a good fellow. He is competent in many ways\\r\\nto teach a Bible class, but when it comes to veracity he is only\\r\\nthirty-five years old. I’m seventy years old. I have been familiar with\\r\\nveracity twice as long as he.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the story about George Washington and his little hatchet has also\\r\\nbeen suggested to me in these letters—in a fugitive way, as if I needed\\r\\nsome of George Washington and his hatchet in my constitution. Why, dear\\r\\nme, they overlook the real point in that story. The point is not the one\\r\\nthat is usually suggested, and you can readily see that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point is not that George said to his father, “Yes, father, I cut\\r\\ndown the cheery-tree; I can’t tell a lie,” but that the little\\r\\nboy—only seven years old—should have his sagacity developed under such\\r\\ncircumstances. He was a boy wise beyond his years. His conduct then was\\r\\na prophecy of later years. Yes, I think he was the most remarkable man\\r\\nthe country ever produced-up to my time, anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow then, little George realized that circumstantial evidence was\\r\\nagainst him. He knew that his father would know from the size of the\\r\\nchips that no full-grown hatchet cut that tree down, and that no man\\r\\nwould have haggled it so. He knew that his father would send around the\\r\\nplantation and inquire for a small boy with a hatchet, and he had the\\r\\nwisdom to come out and confess it. Now, the idea that his father was\\r\\noverjoyed when he told little George that he would rather have him cut\\r\\ndown, a thousand cheery-trees than tell a lie is all nonsense. What did\\r\\nhe really mean? Why, that he was absolutely astonished that he had a son\\r\\nwho had the chance to tell a lie and didn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nI admire old George—if that was his name—for his discernment. He knew\\r\\nwhen he said that his son couldn’t tell a lie that he was stretching it\\r\\na good deal. He wouldn’t have to go to John D. Rockefeller’s Bible class\\r\\nto find that out. The way the old George Washington story goes down it\\r\\ndoesn’t do anybody any good. It only discourages people who can tell a\\r\\nlie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWELCOME HOME\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE DINNER IN HIS HONOR AT THE LOTOS CLUB,\\r\\n          NOVEMBER 10, 1900\\r\\n\\r\\n      In August, 1895, just before sailing for Australia, Mr. Clemens\\r\\n      issued the following statement:\\r\\n\\r\\n“It has been reported that I sacrificed, for the benefit of the\\r\\ncreditors, the property of the publishing firm whose financial backer I\\r\\nwas, and that I am now lecturing for my own benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is an error. I intend the lectures, as well as the property, for\\r\\nthe creditors. The law recognizes no mortgage on a man’s brains, and a\\r\\nmerchant who has given up all he has may take advantage of the laws of\\r\\ninsolvency and may start free again for himself. But I am not a business\\r\\nman, and honor is a harder master than the law. It cannot compromise\\r\\nfor less than one hundred cents on a dollar, and its debts are never\\r\\noutlawed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had a two-thirds interest in the publishing firm whose capital I\\r\\nfurnished. If the firm had prospered I would have expected to collect\\r\\ntwo-thirds of the profits. As it is, I expect to pay all the debts. My\\r\\npartner has no resources, and I do not look for assistance to my wife,\\r\\nwhose contributions in cash from her own means have nearly equalled\\r\\nthe claims of all the creditors combined. She has taken nothing; on\\r\\nthe contrary, she has helped and intends to help me to satisfy the\\r\\nobligations due to the rest of the creditors.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is my intention to ask my creditors to accept that as a legal\\r\\ndischarge, and trust to my honor to pay the other fifty per cent. as\\r\\nfast as I can earn it. From my reception thus far on my lecturing tour,\\r\\nI am confident that if I live I can pay off the last debt within four\\r\\nyears.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After which, at the age of sixty-four, I can make a fresh and\\r\\nunincumbered start in life. I am going to Australia, India, and South\\r\\nAfrica, and next year I hope to make a tour of the great cities of the\\r\\nUnited States.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI thank you all out of my heart for this fraternal welcome, and it seems\\r\\nalmost too fine, almost too magnificent, for a humble Missourian such as\\r\\nI am, far from his native haunts on the banks of the Mississippi; yet\\r\\nmy modesty is in a degree fortified by observing that I am not the only\\r\\nMissourian who has been honored here to-night, for I see at this very\\r\\ntable-here is a Missourian [indicating Mr. McKelway], and there is a\\r\\nMissourian [indicating Mr. Depew], and there is another Missourian—and\\r\\nHendrix and Clemens; and last but not least, the greatest Missourian of\\r\\nthem all—here he sits—Tom Reed, who has always concealed his birth till\\r\\nnow. And since I have been away I know what has been happening in his\\r\\ncase: he has deserted politics, and now is leading a creditable life.\\r\\nHe has reformed, and God prosper him; and I judge, by a remark which\\r\\nhe made up-stairs awhile ago, that he had found a new business that is\\r\\nutterly suited to his make and constitution, and all he is doing now is\\r\\nthat he is around raising the average of personal beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I am grateful to the president for the kind words which he has said\\r\\nof me, and it is not for me to say whether these praises were deserved\\r\\nor not. I prefer to accept them just as they stand, without concerning\\r\\nmyself with the statistics upon which they have been built, but only\\r\\nwith that large matter, that essential matter, the good-fellowship,\\r\\nthe kindliness, the magnanimity, and generosity that prompted their\\r\\nutterance. Well, many things have happened since I sat here before, and\\r\\nnow that I think of it, the president’s reference to the debts which\\r\\nwere left by the bankrupt firm of Charles L. Webster & Co. gives me an\\r\\nopportunity to say a word which I very much wish to say, not for myself,\\r\\nbut for ninety-five men and women whom I shall always hold in high\\r\\nesteem and in pleasant remembrance—the creditors of that firm. They\\r\\ntreated me well; they treated me handsomely. There were ninety-six of\\r\\nthem, and by not a finger’s weight did ninety-five of them add to the\\r\\nburden of that time for me. Ninety-five out of the ninety-six—they\\r\\ndidn’t indicate by any word or sign that they were anxious about their\\r\\nmoney. They treated me well, and I shall not forget it; I could not\\r\\nforget it if I wanted to. Many of them said, “Don’t you worry, don’t\\r\\nyou hurry”; that’s what they said. Why, if I could have that kind\\r\\nof creditors always, and that experience, I would recognize it as a\\r\\npersonal loss to be out of debt. I owe those ninety-five creditors a\\r\\ndebt of homage, and I pay it now in such measure as one may pay so\\r\\nfine a debt in mere words. Yes, they said that very thing. I was not\\r\\npersonally acquainted with ten of them, and yet they said, “Don’t you\\r\\nworry, and don’t you hurry.” I know that phrase by heart, and if all the\\r\\nother music should perish out of the world it would still sing to me.\\r\\nI appreciate that; I am glad to say this word; people say so much about\\r\\nme, and they forget those creditors. They were handsomer than I was—or\\r\\nTom Reed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, you have been doing many things in this time that I have been\\r\\nabsent; you have done lots of things, some that are well worth\\r\\nremembering, too. Now, we have fought a righteous war since I have gone,\\r\\nand that is rare in history—a righteous war is so rare that it is almost\\r\\nunknown in history; but by the grace of that war we set Cuba free, and\\r\\nwe joined her to those three or four nations that exist on this earth;\\r\\nand we started out to set those poor Filipinos free, too, and why, why,\\r\\nwhy that most righteous purpose of ours has apparently miscarried I\\r\\nsuppose I never shall know.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we have made a most creditable record in China in these days—our\\r\\nsound and level-headed administration has made a most creditable record\\r\\nover there, and there are some of the Powers that cannot say that by any\\r\\nmeans. The Yellow Terror is threatening this world to-day. It is looming\\r\\nvast and ominous on that distant horizon. I do not know what is going to\\r\\nbe the result of that Yellow Terror, but our government has had no hand\\r\\nin evoking it, and let’s be happy in that and proud of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have nursed free silver, we watched by its cradle; we have done the\\r\\nbest we could to raise that child, but those pestiferous Republicans\\r\\nhave—well, they keep giving it the measles every chance they get, and we\\r\\nnever shall raise that child. Well, that’s no matter—there’s plenty of\\r\\nother things to do, and we must think of something else. Well, we have\\r\\ntried a President four years, criticised him and found fault with him\\r\\nthe whole time, and turned around a day or two ago with votes enough\\r\\nto spare to elect another. O consistency! consistency! thy name—I don’t\\r\\nknow what thy name is—Thompson will do—any name will do—but you see\\r\\nthere is the fact, there is the consistency. Then we have tried for\\r\\ngovernor an illustrious Rough Rider, and we liked him so much in that\\r\\ngreat office that now we have made him Vice-President—not in order\\r\\nthat that office shall give him distinction, but that he may confer\\r\\ndistinction upon that office. And it’s needed, too—it’s needed. And now,\\r\\nfor a while anyway, we shall not be stammering and embarrassed when a\\r\\nstranger asks us, “What is the name of the Vice-President?” This one is\\r\\nknown; this one is pretty well known, pretty widely known, and in some\\r\\nquarters favorably. I am not accustomed to dealing in these fulsome\\r\\ncompliments, and I am probably overdoing it a little; but—well, my old\\r\\naffectionate admiration for Governor Roosevelt has probably betrayed me\\r\\ninto the complimentary excess; but I know him, and you know him; and\\r\\nif you give him rope enough—I mean if—oh yes, he will justify that\\r\\ncompliment; leave it just as it is. And now we have put in his place\\r\\nMr. Odell, another Rough Rider, I suppose; all the fat things go to that\\r\\nprofession now. Why, I could have been a Rough Rider myself if I had\\r\\nknown that this political Klondike was going to open up, and I would\\r\\nhave been a Rough Rider if I could have gone to war on an automobile but\\r\\nnot on a horse! No, I know the horse too well; I have known the horse\\r\\nin war and in peace, and there is no place where a horse is comfortable.\\r\\nThe horse has too many caprices, and he is too much given to initiative.\\r\\nHe invents too many new ideas. No, I don’t want anything to do with a\\r\\nhorse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then we have taken Chauncey Depew out of a useful and active\\r\\nlife and made him a Senator—embalmed him, corked him up. And I am not\\r\\ngrieving. That man has said many a true thing about me in his time, and\\r\\nI always said something would happen to him. Look at that [pointing to\\r\\nMr. Depew] gilded mummy! He has made my life a sorrow to me at many a\\r\\nbanquet on both sides of the ocean, and now he has got it. Perish the\\r\\nhand that pulls that cork!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these things have happened, all these things have come to pass,\\r\\nwhile I have been away, and it just shows how little a Mugwump can be\\r\\nmissed in a cold, unfeeling world, even when he is the last one that is\\r\\nleft—a GRAND OLD PARTY all by himself. And there is another thing\\r\\nthat has happened, perhaps the most imposing event of them all: the\\r\\ninstitution called the Daughters of the—Crown—the Daughters of the Royal\\r\\nCrown—has established itself and gone into business. Now, there’s an\\r\\nAmerican idea for you; there’s an idea born of God knows what kind of\\r\\nspecialized insanity, but not softening of the brain—you cannot soften\\r\\na thing that doesn’t exist—the Daughters of the Royal Crown! Nobody\\r\\neligible but American descendants of Charles II. Dear me, how the fancy\\r\\nproduct of that old harem still holds out!\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I am truly glad to foregather with you again, and partake of the\\r\\nbread and salt of this hospitable house once more. Seven years ago, when\\r\\nI was your guest here, when I was old and despondent, you gave me the\\r\\ngrip and the word that lift a man up and make him glad to be alive; and\\r\\nnow I come back from my exile young again, fresh and alive, and ready to\\r\\nbegin life once more, and your welcome puts the finishing touch upon my\\r\\nrestored youth and makes it real to me, and not a gracious dream that\\r\\nmust vanish with the morning. I thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAN UNDELIVERED SPEECH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          The steamship St. Paul was to have been launched from Cramp’s\\r\\n          shipyard in Philadelphia on March 25, 1895.  After the\\r\\n          launching a luncheon was to have been given, at which Mr.\\r\\n          Clemens was to make a speech.  Just before the final word was\\r\\n          given a reporter asked Mr. Clemens for a copy of his speech to\\r\\n          be delivered at the luncheon.  To facilitate the work of the\\r\\n          reporter he loaned him a typewritten copy of the speech.  It\\r\\n          happened, however, that when the blocks were knocked away the\\r\\n          big ship refused to budge, and no amount of labor could move\\r\\n          her an inch.  She had stuck fast upon the ways.  As a result,\\r\\n          the launching was postponed for a week or two; but in the mean\\r\\n          time Mr. Clemens had gone to Europe.  Years after a reporter\\r\\n          called on Mr. Clemens and submitted the manuscript of the\\r\\n          speech, which was as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nDay after to-morrow I sail for England in a ship of this line, the\\r\\nParis. It will be my fourteenth crossing in three years and a half.\\r\\nTherefore, my presence here, as you see, is quite natural, quite\\r\\ncommercial. I am interested in ships. They interest me more now than\\r\\nhotels do. When a new ship is launched I feel a desire to go and see if\\r\\nshe will be good quarters for me to live in, particularly if she\\r\\nbelongs to this line, for it is by this line that I have done most of my\\r\\nferrying.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople wonder why I go so much. Well, I go partly for my health, partly\\r\\nto familiarize myself with the road. I have gone over the same road so\\r\\nmany times now that I know all the whales that belong along the route,\\r\\nand latterly it is an embarrassment to me to meet them, for they do not\\r\\nlook glad to see me, but annoyed, and they seem to say: “Here is this\\r\\nold derelict again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier in life this would have pained me and made me ashamed, but I am\\r\\nolder now, and when I am behaving myself, and doing right, I do not care\\r\\nfor a whale’s opinion about me. When we are young we generally estimate\\r\\nan opinion by the size of the person that holds it, but later we find\\r\\nthat that is an uncertain rule, for we realize that there are times when\\r\\na hornet’s opinion disturbs us more than an emperor’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not mean that I care nothing at all for a whale’s opinion, for that\\r\\nwould be going to too great a length. Of course, it is better to have\\r\\nthe good opinion of a whale than his disapproval; but my position is\\r\\nthat if you cannot have a whale’s good opinion, except at some sacrifice\\r\\nof principle or personal dignity, it is better to try to live without\\r\\nit. That is my idea about whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, I have gone over that same route so often that I know my way\\r\\nwithout a compass, just by the waves. I know all the large waves and a\\r\\ngood many of the small ones. Also the sunsets. I know every sunset and\\r\\nwhere it belongs just by its color. Necessarily, then, I do not make the\\r\\npassage now for scenery. That is all gone by.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I prize most is safety, and in the second place swift transit\\r\\nand handiness. These are best furnished, by the American line, whose\\r\\nwatertight compartments have no passage through them; no doors to be\\r\\nleft open, and consequently no way for water to get from one of them to\\r\\nanother in time of collision. If you nullify the peril which collisions\\r\\nthreaten you with, you nullify the only very serious peril which attends\\r\\nvoyages in the great liners of our day, and makes voyaging safer than\\r\\nstaying at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Paris was half-torn to pieces some years ago, enough of the\\r\\nAtlantic ebbed and flowed through one end of her, during her long agony,\\r\\nto sink the fleets of the world if distributed among them; but she\\r\\nfloated in perfect safety, and no life was lost. In time of collision\\r\\nthe rock of Gibraltar is not safer than the Paris and other great ships\\r\\nof this line. This seems to be the only great line in the world that\\r\\ntakes a passenger from metropolis to metropolis without the intervention\\r\\nof tugs and barges or bridges—takes him through without breaking bulk,\\r\\nso to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the English side he lands at a dock; on the dock a special train is\\r\\nwaiting; in an hour and three-quarters he is in London. Nothing could\\r\\nbe handier. If your journey were from a sand-pit on our side to a\\r\\nlighthouse on the other, you could make it quicker by other lines, but\\r\\nthat is not the case. The journey is from the city of New York to the\\r\\ncity of London, and no line can do that journey quicker than this one,\\r\\nnor anywhere near as conveniently and handily. And when the passenger\\r\\nlands on our side he lands on the American side of the river, not in\\r\\nthe provinces. As a very learned man said on the last voyage (he is head\\r\\nquartermaster of the New York land garboard streak of the middle watch),\\r\\n\\r\\n“When we land a passenger on the American side there’s nothing betwix\\r\\nhim and his hotel but hell and the hackman.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad, with you and the nation, to welcome the new ship. She is\\r\\nanother pride, another consolation, for a great country whose mighty\\r\\nfleets have all vanished, and which has almost forgotten what it is to\\r\\nfly its flag to sea. I am not sure as to which St. Paul she is named\\r\\nfor. Some think it is the one that is on the upper Mississippi, but the\\r\\nhead quartermaster told me it was the one that killed Goliath. But it is\\r\\nnot important. No matter which it is, let us give her hearty welcome and\\r\\ngodspeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIXTY-SEVENTH BIRTHDAY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          AT THE METROPOLITAN CLUB, NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 28, 1902\\r\\n\\r\\n          Address at a dinner given in honor of Mr. Clemens by Colonel\\r\\n          Harvey, President of Harper &amp; Brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think I ought to be allowed to talk as long as I want to, for the\\r\\nreason that I have cancelled all my winter’s engagements of every kind,\\r\\nfor good and sufficient reasons, and am making no new engagements for\\r\\nthis winter, and, therefore, this is the only chance I shall have to\\r\\ndisembowel my skull for a year—close the mouth in that portrait for\\r\\na year. I want to offer thanks and homage to the chairman for this\\r\\ninnovation which he has introduced here, which is an improvement, as\\r\\nI consider it, on the old-fashioned style of conducting occasions like\\r\\nthis. That was bad that was a bad, bad, bad arrangement. Under that old\\r\\ncustom the chairman got up and made a speech, he introduced the prisoner\\r\\nat the bar, and covered him all over with compliments, nothing but\\r\\ncompliments, not a thing but compliments, never a slur, and sat down\\r\\nand left that man to get up and talk without a text. You cannot talk on\\r\\ncompliments; that is not a text. No modest person, and I was born one,\\r\\ncan talk on compliments. A man gets up and is filled to the eyes with\\r\\nhappy emotions, but his tongue is tied; he has nothing to say; he is in\\r\\nthe condition of Doctor Rice’s friend who came home drunk and explained\\r\\nit to his wife, and his wife said to him, “John, when you have drunk all\\r\\nthe whiskey you want, you ought to ask for sarsaparilla.” He said, “Yes,\\r\\nbut when I have drunk all the whiskey I want I can’t say sarsaparilla.”\\r\\n And so I think it is much better to leave a man unmolested until the\\r\\ntestimony and pleadings are all in. Otherwise he is dumb—he is at the\\r\\nsarsaparilla stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I get to the higgledy-piggledy point, as Mr. Howells suggested\\r\\nI do, I want to thank you, gentlemen, for this very high honor you are\\r\\ndoing me, and I am quite competent to estimate it at its value. I see\\r\\naround me captains of all the illustrious industries, most distinguished\\r\\nmen; there are more than fifty here, and I believe I know thirty-nine of\\r\\nthem well. I could probably borrow money from—from the others, anyway.\\r\\nIt is a proud thing to me, indeed, to see such a distinguished company\\r\\ngather here on such an occasion as this, when there is no foreign\\r\\nprince to be feted—when you have come here not to do honor to hereditary\\r\\nprivilege and ancient lineage, but to do reverence to mere moral\\r\\nexcellence and elemental veracity-and, dear me, how old it seems to make\\r\\nme! I look around me and I see three or four persons I have known so\\r\\nmany, many years. I have known Mr. Secretary Hay—John Hay, as the nation\\r\\nand the rest of his friends love to call him—I have known John Hay and\\r\\nTom Reed and the Reverend Twichell close upon thirty-six years. Close\\r\\nupon thirty-six years I have known those venerable men. I have known Mr.\\r\\nHowells nearly thirty-four years, and I knew Chauncey Depew before\\r\\nhe could walk straight, and before he learned to tell the truth.\\r\\nTwenty-seven years ago, I heard him make the most noble and eloquent and\\r\\nbeautiful speech that has ever fallen from even his capable lips. Tom\\r\\nReed said that my principal defect was inaccuracy of statement. Well,\\r\\nsuppose that that is true. What’s the use of telling the truth all the\\r\\ntime? I never tell the truth about Tom Reed—but that is his defect,\\r\\ntruth; he speaks the truth always. Tom Reed has a good heart, and he\\r\\nhas a good intellect, but he hasn’t any judgment. Why, when Tom Reed\\r\\nwas invited to lecture to the Ladies’ Society for the Procreation\\r\\nor Procrastination, or something, of morals, I don’t know what\\r\\nit was—advancement, I suppose, of pure morals—he had the immortal\\r\\nindiscretion to begin by saying that some of us can’t be optimists, but\\r\\nby judiciously utilizing the opportunities that Providence puts in our\\r\\nway we can all be bigamists. You perceive his limitations. Anything he\\r\\nhas in his mind he states, if he thinks it is true. Well, that was true,\\r\\nbut that was no place to say it—so they fired him out.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of accounts have been settled here tonight for me; I have held\\r\\ngrudges against some of these people, but they have all been wiped out\\r\\nby the very handsome compliments that have been paid me. Even Wayne\\r\\nMacVeagh—I have had a grudge against him many years. The first time I\\r\\nsaw Wayne MacVeagh was at a private dinner-party at Charles A. Dana’s,\\r\\nand when I got there he was clattering along, and I tried to get a\\r\\nword in here and there; but you know what Wayne MacVeagh is when he is\\r\\nstarted, and I could not get in five words to his one—or one word to his\\r\\nfive. I struggled along and struggled along, and—well, I wanted to tell\\r\\nand I was trying to tell a dream I had had the night before, and it was\\r\\na remarkable dream, a dream worth people’s while to listen to, a dream\\r\\nrecounting Sam Jones the revivalist’s reception in heaven. I was on a\\r\\ntrain, and was approaching the celestial way-station—I had a through\\r\\nticket—and I noticed a man sitting alongside of me asleep, and he\\r\\nhad his ticket in his hat. He was the remains of the Archbishop of\\r\\nCanterbury; I recognized him by his photograph. I had nothing against\\r\\nhim, so I took his ticket and let him have mine. He didn’t object—he\\r\\nwasn’t in a condition to object—and presently when the train stopped\\r\\nat the heavenly station—well, I got off, and he went on by request—but\\r\\nthere they all were, the angels, you know, millions of them, every one\\r\\nwith a torch; they had arranged for a torch-light procession; they were\\r\\nexpecting the Archbishop, and when I got off they started to raise\\r\\na shout, but it didn’t materialize. I don’t know whether they were\\r\\ndisappointed. I suppose they had a lot of superstitious ideas about the\\r\\nArchbishop and what he should look like, and I didn’t fill the bill, and\\r\\nI was trying to explain to Saint Peter, and was doing it in the German\\r\\ntongue, because I didn’t want to be too explicit. Well, I found it was\\r\\nno use, I couldn’t get along, for Wayne MacVeagh was occupying the whole\\r\\nplace, and I said to Mr. Dana, “What is the matter with that man? Who is\\r\\nthat man with the long tongue? What’s the trouble with him, that long,\\r\\nlank cadaver, old oil-derrick out of a job—who is that?” “Well, now,”\\r\\n Mr. Dana said, “you don’t want to meddle with him; you had better keep\\r\\nquiet; just keep quiet, because that’s a bad man. Talk! He was born to\\r\\ntalk. Don’t let him get out with you; he’ll skin you.” I said, “I have\\r\\nbeen skinned, skinned, and skinned for years, there is nothing left.”\\r\\n He said, “Oh, you’ll find there is; that man is the very seed and\\r\\ninspiration of that proverb which says, ‘No matter how close you skin an\\r\\nonion, a clever man can always peel it again.’” Well, I reflected and\\r\\nI quieted down. That would never occur to Tom Reed. He’s got no\\r\\ndiscretion. Well, MacVeagh is just the same man; he hasn’t changed a bit\\r\\nin all those years; he has been peeling Mr. Mitchell lately. That’s the\\r\\nkind of man he is.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Howells—that poem of his is admirable; that’s the way to treat a\\r\\nperson. Howells has a peculiar gift for seeing the merits of people,\\r\\nand he has always exhibited them in my favor. Howells has never written\\r\\nanything about me that I couldn’t read six or seven times a day; he is\\r\\nalways just and always fair; he has written more appreciatively of\\r\\nme than any one in this world, and published it in the North American\\r\\nReview. He did me the justice to say that my intentions—he italicized\\r\\nthat—that my intentions were always good, that I wounded people’s\\r\\nconventions rather than their convictions. Now, I wouldn’t want anything\\r\\nhandsomer than that said of me. I would rather wait, with anything harsh\\r\\nI might have to say, till the convictions become conventions. Bangs has\\r\\ntraced me all the way down. He can’t find that honest man, but I will\\r\\nlook for him in the looking-glass when I get home. It was intimated by\\r\\nthe Colonel that it is New England that makes New York and builds up\\r\\nthis country and makes it great, overlooking the fact that there’s a\\r\\nlot of people here who came from elsewhere, like John Hay from away\\r\\nout West, and Howells from Ohio, and St. Clair McKelway and me\\r\\nfrom Missouri, and we are doing what we can to build up New York a\\r\\nlittle-elevate it. Why, when I was living in that village of Hannibal,\\r\\nMissouri, on the banks of the Mississippi, and Hay up in the town of\\r\\nWarsaw, also on the banks of the Mississippi River it is an emotional\\r\\nbit of the Mississippi, and when it is low water you have to climb up\\r\\nto it on a ladder, and when it floods you have to hunt for it; with a\\r\\ndeep-sea lead—but it is a great and beautiful country. In that old time\\r\\nit was a paradise for simplicity—it was a simple, simple life, cheap but\\r\\ncomfortable, and full of sweetness, and there was nothing of this rage\\r\\nof modern civilization there at all. It was a delectable land. I went\\r\\nout there last June, and I met in that town of Hannibal a schoolmate of\\r\\nmine, John Briggs, whom I had not seen for more than fifty years. I tell\\r\\nyou, that was a meeting! That pal whom I had known as a little boy long\\r\\nago, and knew now as a stately man three or four inches over six feet\\r\\nand browned by exposure to many climes, he was back there to see that\\r\\nold place again. We spent a whole afternoon going about here and there\\r\\nand yonder, and hunting up the scenes and talking of the crimes which\\r\\nwe had committed so long ago. It was a heartbreaking delight, full of\\r\\npathos, laughter, and tears, all mixed together; and we called the roll\\r\\nof the boys and girls that we picnicked and sweethearted with so many\\r\\nyears ago, and there were hardly half a dozen of them left; the rest\\r\\nwere in their graves; and we went up there on the summit of that hill,\\r\\na treasured place in my memory, the summit of Holiday’s Hill, and looked\\r\\nout again over that magnificent panorama of the Mississippi River,\\r\\nsweeping along league after league, a level green paradise on one side,\\r\\nand retreating capes and promontories as far as you could see on the\\r\\nother, fading away in the soft, rich lights of the remote distance. I\\r\\nrecognized then that I was seeing now the most enchanting river view\\r\\nthe planet could furnish. I never knew it when I was a boy; it took an\\r\\neducated eye that had travelled over the globe to know and appreciate\\r\\nit; and John said, “Can you point out the place where Bear Creek used to\\r\\nbe before the railroad came?” I said, “Yes, it ran along yonder.” “And\\r\\ncan you point out the swimming-hole?” “Yes, out there.” And he said,\\r\\n“Can you point out the place where we stole the skiff?” Well, I didn’t\\r\\nknow which one he meant. Such a wilderness of events had intervened\\r\\nsince that day, more than fifty years ago, it took me more than five\\r\\nminutes to call back that little incident, and then I did call it back;\\r\\nit was a white skiff, and we painted it red to allay suspicion. And the\\r\\nsaddest, saddest man came along—a stranger he was—and he looked that red\\r\\nskiff over so pathetically, and he said: “Well, if it weren’t for the\\r\\ncomplexion I’d know whose skiff that was.” He said it in that pleading\\r\\nway, you know, that appeals for sympathy and suggestion; we were full of\\r\\nsympathy for him, but we weren’t in any condition to offer suggestions.\\r\\nI can see him yet as he turned away with that same sad look on his face\\r\\nand vanished out of history forever. I wonder what became of that man.\\r\\nI know what became of the skiff. Well, it was a beautiful life, a lovely\\r\\nlife. There was no crime. Merely little things like pillaging orchards\\r\\nand watermelon-patches and breaking the Sabbath—we didn’t break the\\r\\nSabbath often enough to signify—once a week perhaps. But we were good\\r\\nboys, good Presbyterian boys, all Presbyterian boys, and loyal and\\r\\nall that; anyway, we were good Presbyterian boys when the weather was\\r\\ndoubtful; when it was fair, we did wander a little from the fold.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook at John Hay and me. There we were in obscurity, and look where\\r\\nwe are now. Consider the ladder which he has climbed, the illustrious\\r\\nvocations he has served—and vocations is the right word; he has in all\\r\\nthose vocations acquitted himself with high credit and honor to his\\r\\ncountry and to the mother that bore him. Scholar, soldier, diplomat,\\r\\npoet, historian—now, see where we are. He is Secretary of State and I am\\r\\na gentleman. It could not happen in any other country. Our institutions\\r\\ngive men the positions that of right belong to them through merit;\\r\\nall you men have won your places, not by heredities, and not by family\\r\\ninfluence or extraneous help, but only by the natural gifts God gave you\\r\\nat your birth, made effective by your own energies; this is the country\\r\\nto live in.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there is one invisible guest here. A part of me is present; the\\r\\nlarger part, the better part, is yonder at her home; that is my wife,\\r\\nand she has a good many personal friends here, and I think it won’t\\r\\ndistress any one of them to know that, although she is going to\\r\\nbe confined to that bed for many months to come from that nervous\\r\\nprostration, there is not any danger and she is coming along very\\r\\nwell—and I think it quite appropriate that I should speak of her. I knew\\r\\nher for the first time just in the same year that I first knew John Hay\\r\\nand Tom Reed and Mr. Twichell—thirty-six years ago—and she has been the\\r\\nbest friend I have ever had, and that is saying a good deal; she\\r\\nhas reared me—she and Twichell together—and what I am I owe to them.\\r\\nTwichell—why, it is such a pleasure to look upon Twichell’s face! For\\r\\nfive-and-twenty years I was under the Rev. Mr. Twichell’s tuition, I\\r\\nwas in his pastorate, occupying a pew in his church, and held him in due\\r\\nreverence. That man is full of all the graces that go to make a person\\r\\ncompanionable and beloved; and wherever Twichell goes to start a church\\r\\nthe people flock there to buy the land; they find real estate goes up\\r\\nall around the spot, and the envious and the thoughtful always try\\r\\nto get Twichell to move to their neighborhood and start a church; and\\r\\nwherever you see him go you can go and buy land there with confidence,\\r\\nfeeling sure that there will be a double price for you before very long.\\r\\nI am not saying this to flatter Mr. Twichell; it is the fact. Many and\\r\\nmany a time I have attended the annual sale in his church, and bought\\r\\nup all the pews on a margin—and it would have been better for me\\r\\nspiritually and financially if I had stayed under his wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have tried to do good in this world, and it is marvellous in how many\\r\\ndifferent ways I have done good, and it is comfortable to reflect—now,\\r\\nthere’s Mr. Rogers—just out of the affection I bear that man many a time\\r\\nI have given him points in finance that he had never thought of—and if\\r\\nhe could lay aside envy, prejudice, and superstition, and utilize those\\r\\nideas in his business, it would make a difference in his bank account.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I like the poetry. I like all the speeches and the poetry, too.\\r\\nI liked Doctor Van Dyke’s poem. I wish I could return thanks in proper\\r\\nmeasure to you, gentlemen, who have spoken and violated your feelings\\r\\nto pay me compliments; some were merited and some you overlooked, it is\\r\\ntrue; and Colonel Harvey did slander every one of you, and put things\\r\\ninto my mouth that I never said, never thought of at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, my wife and I, out of our single heart, return you our deepest\\r\\nand most grateful thanks, and—yesterday was her birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE WHITEFRIARS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE DINNER GIVEN BY THE WHITEFRIARS CLUB IN HONOR OF\\r\\n          MR. CLEMENS, LONDON, JUNE 20, 1899\\r\\n\\r\\n          The Whitefriars Club was founded by Dr. Samuel Johnson, and Mr.\\r\\n          Clemens was made an honorary member in 1874.  The members are\\r\\n          representative of literary and journalistic London.  The toast\\r\\n          of “Our Guest” was proposed by Louis F. Austin, of the\\r\\n          Illustrated London News, and in the course of some humorous\\r\\n          remarks he referred to the vow and to the imaginary woes of the\\r\\n          “Friars,” as the members of the club style themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND BRETHREN OF THE VOW—in whatever the vow is; for\\r\\nalthough I have been a member of this club for five-and twenty years, I\\r\\ndon’t know any more about what that vow is than Mr. Austin seems to. But\\r\\nwhat ever the vow is, I don’t care what it is. I have made a thousand\\r\\nvows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no pleasure comparable to making a vow in the presence of\\r\\none who appreciates that vow, in the presence of men who honor and\\r\\nappreciate you for making the vow, and men who admire you for making the\\r\\nvow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is only one pleasure higher than that, and that is to get outside\\r\\nand break the vow. A vow is always a pledge of some kind or other for\\r\\nthe protection of your own morals and principles or somebody else’s, and\\r\\ngenerally, by the irony of fate, it is for the protection of your own\\r\\nmorals.\\r\\n\\r\\nHence we have pledges that make us eschew tobacco or wine, and while\\r\\nyou are taking the pledge there is a holy influence about that makes you\\r\\nfeel you are reformed, and that you can never be so happy again in this\\r\\nworld until—you get outside and take a drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had forgotten that I was a member of this club—it is so long ago. But\\r\\nnow I remember that I was here five-and-twenty years ago, and that I was\\r\\nthen at a dinner of the Whitefriars Club, and it was in those old days\\r\\nwhen you had just made two great finds. All London was talking about\\r\\nnothing else than that they had found Livingstone, and that the lost Sir\\r\\nRoger Tichborne had been found—and they were trying him for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at the dinner, Chairman (I do not know who he was)—failed to come\\r\\nto time. The gentleman who had been appointed to pay me the customary\\r\\ncompliments and to introduce me forgot the compliments, and did not know\\r\\nwhat they were.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd George Augustus Sala came in at the last moment, just when I was\\r\\nabout to go without compliments altogether. And that man was a gifted\\r\\nman. They just called on him instantaneously, while he was going to sit\\r\\ndown, to introduce the stranger, and Sala, made one of those marvellous\\r\\nspeeches which he was capable of making. I think no man talked so fast\\r\\nas Sala did. One did not need wine while he was making a speech. The\\r\\nrapidity of his utterance made a man drunk in a minute. An incomparable\\r\\nspeech was that, an impromptu speech, and—an impromptu speech is a\\r\\nseldom thing, and he did it so well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went into the whole history of the United States, and made it\\r\\nentirely new to me. He filled it with episodes and incidents that\\r\\nWashington never heard of, and he did it so convincingly that although\\r\\nI knew none of it had happened, from that day to this I do not know any\\r\\nhistory but Sala’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not know anything so sad as a dinner where you are going to get up\\r\\nand say something by-and-by, and you do not know what it is. You sit\\r\\nand wonder and wonder what the gentleman is going to say who is going\\r\\nto introduce you. You know that if he says something severe, that if he\\r\\nwill deride you, or traduce you, or do anything of that kind, he will\\r\\nfurnish you with a text, because anybody can get up and talk against\\r\\nthat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnybody can get up and straighten out his character. But when a\\r\\ngentleman gets up and merely tells the truth about you, what can you do?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Austin has done well. He has supplied so many texts that I will have\\r\\nto drop out a lot of them, and that is about as difficult as when you\\r\\ndo not have any text at all. Now, he made a beautiful and smooth speech\\r\\nwithout any difficulty at all, and I could have done that if I had gone\\r\\non with the schooling with which I began. I see here a gentleman on my\\r\\nleft who was my master in the art of oratory more than twenty-five years\\r\\nago.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I look upon the inspiring face of Mr. Depew, it carries me a long\\r\\nway back. An old and valued friend of mine is he, and I saw his career\\r\\nas it came along, and it has reached pretty well up to now, when he, by\\r\\nanother miscarriage of justice, is a United States Senator. But those\\r\\nwere delightful days when I was taking lessons in oratory.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy other master the Ambassador-is not here yet. Under those two\\r\\ngentlemen I learned to make after-dinner speeches, and it was charming.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know the New England dinner is the great occasion on the other side\\r\\nof the water. It is held every year to celebrate the landing of the\\r\\nPilgrims. Those Pilgrims were a lot of people who were not needed in\\r\\nEngland, and you know they had great rivalry, and they were persuaded to\\r\\ngo elsewhere, and they chartered a ship called Mayflower and set sail,\\r\\nand I have heard it said that they pumped the Atlantic Ocean through\\r\\nthat ship sixteen times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey fell in over there with the Dutch from Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and\\r\\na lot of other places with profane names, and it is from that gang that\\r\\nMr. Depew is descended.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, Mr. Choate is descended from those Puritans who\\r\\nlanded on a bitter night in December. Every year those people used\\r\\nto meet at a great banquet in New York, and those masters of mind in\\r\\noratory had to make speeches. It was Doctor Depew’s business to get up\\r\\nthere and apologise for the Dutch, and Mr. Choate had to get up later\\r\\nand explain the crimes of the Puritans, and grand, beautiful times we\\r\\nused to have.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is curious that after that long lapse of time I meet the Whitefriars\\r\\nagain, some looking as young and fresh as in the old days, others\\r\\nshowing a certain amount of wear and tear, and here, after all this\\r\\ntime, I find one of the masters of oratory and the others named in the\\r\\nlist.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here we three meet again as exiles on one pretext or another,\\r\\nand you will notice that while we are absent there is a pleasing\\r\\ntranquillity in America—a building up of public confidence. We are doing\\r\\nthe best we can for our country. I think we have spent our lives in\\r\\nserving our country, and we never serve it to greater advantage than\\r\\nwhen we get out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut impromptu speaking—that is what I was trying to learn. That is a\\r\\ndifficult thing. I used to do it in this way. I used to begin about a\\r\\nweek ahead, and write out my impromptu speech and get it by heart. Then\\r\\nI brought it to the New England dinner printed on a piece of paper in my\\r\\npocket, so that I could pass it to the reporters all cut and dried,\\r\\nand in order to do an impromptu speech as it should be done you have to\\r\\nindicate the places for pauses and hesitations. I put them all in it.\\r\\nAnd then you want the applause in the right places.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got to the place where it should come in, if it did not come in\\r\\nI did not care, but I had it marked in the paper. And these masters of\\r\\nmind used to wonder why it was my speech came out in the morning in the\\r\\nfirst person, while theirs went through the butchery of synopsis.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do that kind of speech (I mean an offhand speech), and do it well,\\r\\nand make no mistake in such a way to deceive the audience completely and\\r\\nmake that audience believe it is an impromptu speech—that is art.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was frightened out of it at last by an experience of Doctor Hayes. He\\r\\nwas a sort of Nansen of that day. He had been to the North Pole, and it\\r\\nmade him celebrated. He had even seen the polar bear climb the pole.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had made one of those magnificent voyages such as Nansen made, and in\\r\\nthose days when a man did anything which greatly distinguished him for\\r\\nthe moment he had to come on to the lecture platform and tell all about\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoctor Hayes was a great, magnificent creature like Nansen, superbly\\r\\nbuilt. He was to appear in Boston. He wrote his lecture out, and it was\\r\\nhis purpose to read it from manuscript; but in an evil hour he concluded\\r\\nthat it would be a good thing to preface it with something rather\\r\\nhandsome, poetical, and beautiful that he could get off by heart and\\r\\ndeliver as if it were the thought of the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not had my experience, and could not do that. He came on the\\r\\nplatform, held his manuscript down, and began with a beautiful piece of\\r\\noratory. He spoke something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n“When a lonely human being, a pigmy in the midst of the architecture\\r\\nof nature, stands solitary on those icy waters and looks abroad to the\\r\\nhorizon and sees mighty castles and temples of eternal ice raising up\\r\\ntheir pinnacles tipped by the pencil of the departing sun—”\\r\\n\\r\\nHere a man came across the platform and touched him on the shoulder, and\\r\\nsaid: “One minute.” And then to the audience:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is Mrs. John Smith in the house? Her husband has slipped on the ice and\\r\\nbroken his leg.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you could see the Mrs. John Smiths get up everywhere and drift out\\r\\nof the house, and it made great gaps everywhere. Then Doctor Hayes began\\r\\nagain: “When a lonely man, a pigmy in the architecture—” The janitor\\r\\ncame in again and shouted: “It is not Mrs. John Smith! It is Mrs. John\\r\\nJones!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all the Mrs. Jones got up and left. Once more the speaker started,\\r\\nand was in the midst of the sentence when he was interrupted again,\\r\\nand the result was that the lecture was not delivered. But the lecturer\\r\\ninterviewed the janitor afterward in a private room, and of the\\r\\nfragments of the janitor they took “twelve basketsful.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I don’t want to sit down just in this way. I have been talking with\\r\\nso much levity that I have said no serious thing, and you are really\\r\\nno better or wiser, although Robert Buchanan has suggested that I am\\r\\na person who deals in wisdom. I have said nothing which would make you\\r\\nbetter than when you came here.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should be sorry to sit down without having said one serious word which\\r\\nyou can carry home and relate to your children and the old people who\\r\\nare not able to get away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this is just a little maxim which has saved me from many a\\r\\ndifficulty and many a disaster, and in times of tribulation and\\r\\nuncertainty has come to my rescue, as it shall to yours if you observe\\r\\nit as I do day and night.\\r\\n\\r\\nI always use it in an emergency, and you can take it home as a legacy\\r\\nfrom me, and it is “When in doubt, tell the truth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ASCOT GOLD CUP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          The news of Mr. Clemens’s arrival in England in June, 1907, was\\r\\n          announced in the papers with big headlines.  Immediately\\r\\n          following the announcement was the news--also with big\\r\\n          headlines--that the Ascot Gold Cup had been stolen the same\\r\\n          day.  The combination, MARK TWAIN ARRIVES-ASCOT CUP STOLEN,\\r\\n          amused the public.  The Lord Mayor of London gave a banquet at\\r\\n          the Mansion House in honor of Mr. Clemens.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do assure you that I am not so dishonest as I look. I have been so\\r\\nbusy trying to rehabilitate my honor about that Ascot Cup that I have\\r\\nhad no time to prepare a speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not so honest in former days as I am now, but I have always\\r\\nbeen reasonably honest. Well, you know how a man is influenced by his\\r\\nsurroundings. Once upon a time I went to a public meeting where the\\r\\noratory of a charitable worker so worked on my feelings that, in common\\r\\nwith others, I would have dropped something substantial in the hat—if it\\r\\nhad come round at that moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speaker had the power of putting those vivid pictures before one. We\\r\\nwere all affected. That was the moment for the hat. I would have put\\r\\ntwo hundred dollars in. Before he had finished I could have put in\\r\\nfour hundred dollars. I felt I could have filled up a blank check—with\\r\\nsomebody else’s name—and dropped it in.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, now, another speaker got up, and in fifteen minutes damped my\\r\\nspirit; and during the speech of the third speaker all my enthusiasm\\r\\nwent away. When at last the hat came round I dropped in ten cents—and\\r\\ntook out twenty-five.\\r\\n\\r\\nI came over here to get the honorary degree from Oxford, and I would\\r\\nhave encompassed the seven seas for an honor like that—the greatest\\r\\nhonor that has ever fallen to my share. I am grateful to Oxford for\\r\\nconferring that honor upon me, and I am sure my country appreciates it,\\r\\nbecause first and foremost it is an honor to my country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now I am going home again across the sea. I am in spirit young but\\r\\nin the flesh old, so that it is unlikely that when I go away I shall\\r\\never see England again. But I shall go with the recollection of the\\r\\ngenerous and kindly welcome I have had.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose I must say “Good-bye.” I say it not with my lips only, but\\r\\nfrom the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SAVAGE CLUB DINNER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          A portrait of Mr. Clemens, signed by all the members of the\\r\\n          club attending the dinner, was presented to him, July 6, 1907,\\r\\n          and in submitting the toast “The Health of Mark Twain” Mr. J.\\r\\n          Scott Stokes recalled the fact that he had read parts of Doctor\\r\\n          Clemens’s works to Harold Frederic during Frederic’s last\\r\\n          illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-SAVAGES,—I am very glad indeed to have that\\r\\nportrait. I think it is the best one that I have ever had, and there\\r\\nhave been opportunities before to get a good photograph. I have sat to\\r\\nphotographers twenty-two times to-day. Those sittings added to those\\r\\nthat have preceded them since I have been in Europe—if we average at\\r\\nthat rate—must have numbered one hundred to two hundred sittings. Out\\r\\nof all those there ought to be some good photographs. This is the best I\\r\\nhave had, and I am glad to have your honored names on it. I did not know\\r\\nHarold Frederic personally, but I have heard a great deal about him, and\\r\\nnothing that was not pleasant and nothing except such things as lead\\r\\na man to honor another man and to love him. I consider that it is a\\r\\nmisfortune of mine that I have never had the luck to meet him, and if\\r\\nany book of mine read to him in his last hours made those hours easier\\r\\nfor him and more comfortable, I am very glad and proud of that. I call\\r\\nto mind such a case many years ago of an English authoress, well known\\r\\nin her day, who wrote such beautiful child tales, touching and lovely in\\r\\nevery possible way. In a little biographical sketch of her I found that\\r\\nher last hours were spent partly in reading a book of mine, until she\\r\\nwas no longer able to read. That has always remained in my mind, and\\r\\nI have always cherished it as one of the good things of my life. I had\\r\\nread what she had written, and had loved her for what she had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley apparently carried a book of mine feloniously away to Africa,\\r\\nand I have not a doubt that it had a noble and uplifting influence there\\r\\nin the wilds of Africa—because on his previous journeys he never carried\\r\\nanything to read except Shakespeare and the Bible. I did not know of\\r\\nthat circumstance. I did not know that he had carried a book of mine.\\r\\nI only noticed that when he came back he was a reformed man. I knew\\r\\nStanley very well in those old days. Stanley was the first man who ever\\r\\nreported a lecture of mine, and that was in St. Louis. When I was down\\r\\nthere the next time to give the same lecture I was told to give them\\r\\nsomething fresh, as they had read that in the papers. I met Stanley here\\r\\nwhen he came back from that first expedition of his which closed with\\r\\nthe finding of Livingstone. You remember how he would break out at the\\r\\nmeetings of the British Association, and find fault with what people\\r\\nsaid, because Stanley had notions of his own, and could not contain\\r\\nthem. They had to come out or break him up—and so he would go round and\\r\\naddress geographical societies. He was always on the warpath in\\r\\nthose days, and people always had to have Stanley contradicting their\\r\\ngeography for them and improving it. But he always came back and sat\\r\\ndrinking beer with me in the hotel up to two in the morning, and he was\\r\\nthen one of the most civilized human beings that ever was.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw in a newspaper this evening a reference to an interview which\\r\\nappeared in one of the papers the other day, in which the interviewer\\r\\nsaid that I characterized Mr. Birrell’s speech the other day at the\\r\\nPilgrims’ Club as “bully.” Now, if you will excuse me, I never use slang\\r\\nto an interviewer or anybody else. That distresses me. Whatever I said\\r\\nabout Mr. Birrell’s speech was said in English, as good English as\\r\\nanybody uses. If I could not describe Mr. Birrell’s delightful speech\\r\\nwithout using slang I would not describe it at all. I would close my\\r\\nmouth and keep it closed, much as it would discomfort me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that comes of interviewing a man in the first person, which is an\\r\\naltogether wrong way to interview him. It is entirely wrong because none\\r\\nof you, I, or anybody else, could interview a man—could listen to a man\\r\\ntalking any length of time and then go off and reproduce that talk in\\r\\nthe first person. It can’t be done. What results is merely that the\\r\\ninterviewer gives the substance of what is said and puts it in his own\\r\\nlanguage and puts it in your mouth. It will always be either better\\r\\nlanguage than you use or worse, and in my case it is always worse.\\r\\nI have a great respect for the English language. I am one of its\\r\\nsupporters, its promoters, its elevators. I don’t degrade it. A slip of\\r\\nthe tongue would be the most that you would get from me. I have always\\r\\ntried hard and faithfully to improve my English and never to degrade it.\\r\\nI always try to use the best English to describe what I think and what I\\r\\nfeel, or what I don’t feel and what I don’t think.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not one of those who in expressing opinions confine themselves to\\r\\nfacts. I don’t know anything that mars good literature so completely as\\r\\ntoo much truth. Facts contain a deal of poetry, but you can’t use too\\r\\nmany of them without damaging your literature. I love all literature,\\r\\nand as long as I am a doctor of literature—I have suggested to you for\\r\\ntwenty years I have been diligently trying to improve my own literature,\\r\\nand now, by virtue of the University of Oxford, I mean to doctor\\r\\neverybody else’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I think I ought to apologize for my clothes. At home I venture\\r\\nthings that I am not permitted by my family to venture in foreign parts.\\r\\nI was instructed before I left home and ordered to refrain from white\\r\\nclothes in England. I meant to keep that command fair and clean, and I\\r\\nwould have done it if I had been in the habit of obeying instructions,\\r\\nbut I can’t invent a new process in life right away. I have not had\\r\\nwhite clothes on since I crossed the ocean until now.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these three or four weeks I have grown so tired of gray and black\\r\\nthat you have earned my gratitude in permitting me to come as I have. I\\r\\nwear white clothes in the depth of winter in my home, but I don’t go out\\r\\nin the streets in them. I don’t go out to attract too much attention.\\r\\nI like to attract some, and always I would like to be dressed so that I\\r\\nmay be more conspicuous than anybody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had been an ancient Briton, I would not have contented myself with\\r\\nblue paint, but I would have bankrupted the rainbow. I so enjoy gay\\r\\nclothes in which women clothe themselves that it always grieves me when\\r\\nI go to the opera to see that, while women look like a flower-bed, the\\r\\nmen are a few gray stumps among them in their black evening dress. These\\r\\nare two or three reasons why I wish to wear white clothes: When I find\\r\\nmyself in assemblies like this, with everybody in black clothes, I know\\r\\nI possess something that is superior to everybody else’s. Clothes are\\r\\nnever clean. You don’t know whether they are clean or not, because you\\r\\ncan’t see.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere or anywhere you must scour your head every two or three days or\\r\\nit is full of grit. Your clothes must collect just as much dirt as your\\r\\nhair. If you wear white clothes you are clean, and your cleaning bill\\r\\ngets so heavy that you have to take care. I am proud to say that I can\\r\\nwear a white suit of clothes without a blemish for three days. If you\\r\\nneed any further instruction in the matter of clothes I shall be glad to\\r\\ngive it to you. I hope I have convinced some of you that it is just as\\r\\nwell to wear white clothes as any other kind. I do not want to boast. I\\r\\nonly want to make you understand that you are not clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to age, the fact that I am nearly seventy-two years old does not\\r\\nclearly indicate how old I am, because part of every day—it is with\\r\\nme as with you, you try to describe your age, and you cannot do it.\\r\\nSometimes you are only fifteen; sometimes you are twenty-five. It is\\r\\nvery seldom in a day that I am seventy-two years old. I am older now\\r\\nsometimes than I was when I used to rob orchards; a thing which I would\\r\\nnot do to-day—if the orchards were watched. I am so glad to be here\\r\\nto-night. I am so glad to renew with the Savages that now ancient time\\r\\nwhen I first sat with a company of this club in London in 1872. That is\\r\\na long time ago. But I did stay with the Savages a night in London long\\r\\nago, and as I had come into a very strange land, and was with friends,\\r\\nas I could see, that has always remained in my mind as a peculiarly\\r\\nblessed evening, since it brought me into contact with men of my own\\r\\nkind and my own feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad to be here, and to see you all again, because it is very\\r\\nlikely that I shall not see you again. It is easier than I thought to\\r\\ncome across the Atlantic. I have been received, as you know, in the most\\r\\ndelightfully generous way in England ever since I came here. It keeps\\r\\nme choked up all the time. Everybody is so generous, and they do seem\\r\\nto give you such a hearty welcome. Nobody in the world can appreciate it\\r\\nhigher than I do. It did not wait till I got to London, but when I came\\r\\nashore at Tilbury the stevedores on the dock raised the first welcome—a\\r\\ngood and hearty welcome from the men who do the heavy labor in the\\r\\nworld, and save you and me having to do it. They are the men who with\\r\\ntheir hands build empires and make them prosper. It is because of them\\r\\nthat the others are wealthy and can live in luxury. They received me\\r\\nwith a “Hurrah!” that went to my heart. They are the men that build\\r\\ncivilization, and without them no civilization can be built. So I came\\r\\nfirst to the authors and creators of civilization, and I blessedly end\\r\\nthis happy meeting with the Savages who destroy it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL MILES AND THE DOG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens was the guest of honor at a dinner given by the\\r\\n          Pleiades Club at the Hotel Brevoort, December 22, 1907.  The\\r\\n          toastmaster introduced the guest of the evening with a high\\r\\n          tribute to his place in American literature, saying that he was\\r\\n          dear to the hearts of all Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is hard work to make a speech when you have listened to compliments\\r\\nfrom the powers in authority. A compliment is a hard text to preach to.\\r\\nWhen the chairman introduces me as a person of merit, and when he says\\r\\npleasant things about me, I always feel like answering simply that what\\r\\nhe says is true; that it is all right; that, as far as I am concerned,\\r\\nthe things he said can stand as they are. But you always have to say\\r\\nsomething, and that is what frightens me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember out in Sydney once having to respond to some complimentary\\r\\ntoast, and my one desire was to turn in my tracks like any other\\r\\nworm—and run, for it. I was remembering that occasion at a later date\\r\\nwhen I had to introduce a speaker. Hoping, then, to spur his speech by\\r\\nputting him, in joke, on the defensive, I accused him in my introduction\\r\\nof everything I thought it impossible for him to have committed. When I\\r\\nfinished there was an awful calm. I had been telling his life history by\\r\\nmistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne must keep up one’s character. Earn a character first if you can,\\r\\nand if you can’t, then assume one. From the code of morals I have been\\r\\nfollowing and revising and revising for seventy-two years I remember\\r\\none detail. All my life I have been honest—comparatively honest. I could\\r\\nnever use money I had not made honestly—I could only lend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast spring I met General Miles again, and he commented on the fact that\\r\\nwe had known each other thirty years. He said it was strange that we had\\r\\nnot met years before, when we had both been in Washington. At that point\\r\\nI changed the subject, and I changed it with art. But the facts are\\r\\nthese:\\r\\n\\r\\nI was then under contract for my Innocents Abroad, but did not have a\\r\\ncent to live on while I wrote it. So I went to Washington to do a little\\r\\njournalism. There I met an equally poor friend, William Davidson, who\\r\\nhad not a single vice, unless you call it a vice in a Scot to love\\r\\nScotch. Together we devised the first and original newspaper syndicate,\\r\\nselling two letters a week to twelve newspapers and getting $1 a letter.\\r\\nThat $24 a week would have been enough for us—if we had not had to\\r\\nsupport the jug.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was a day when we felt that we must have $3 right away—$3\\r\\nat once. That was how I met the General. It doesn’t matter now what\\r\\nwe wanted so much money at one time for, but that Scot and I did\\r\\noccasionally want it. The Scot sent me out one day to get it. He had a\\r\\ngreat belief in Providence, that Scottish friend of mine. He said: “The\\r\\nLord will provide.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI had given up trying to find the money lying about, and was in a hotel\\r\\nlobby in despair, when I saw a beautiful unfriended dog. The dog saw\\r\\nme, too, and at once we became acquainted. Then General Miles came in,\\r\\nadmired the dog, and asked me to price it. I priced it at $3. He offered\\r\\nme an opportunity to reconsider the value of the beautiful animal, but I\\r\\nrefused to take more than Providence knew I needed. The General carried\\r\\nthe dog to his room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came in a sweet little middle-aged man, who at once began looking\\r\\naround the lobby.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you lose a dog?” I asked. He said he had.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I could find it,” I volunteered, “for a small sum.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘How much?’” he asked. And I told him $3.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe urged me to accept more, but I did not wish to outdo Providence. Then\\r\\nI went to the General’s room and asked for the dog back. He was very\\r\\nangry, and wanted to know why I had sold him a dog that did not belong\\r\\nto me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s a singular question to ask me, sir,” I replied. “Didn’t you ask\\r\\nme to sell him? You started it.” And he let me have him. I gave him back\\r\\nhis $3 and returned the dog, collect, to its owner. That second $3 I\\r\\ncarried home to the Scot, and we enjoyed it, but the first $3, the money\\r\\nI got from the General, I would have had to lend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe General seemed not to remember my part in that adventure, and I\\r\\nnever had the heart to tell him about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHEN IN DOUBT, TELL THE TRUTH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mark Twain’s speech at the dinner of the “Freundschaft\\r\\n          Society,” March 9, 1906, had as a basis the words of\\r\\n          introduction used by Toastmaster Frank, who, referring to\\r\\n          Pudd’nhead Wilson, used the phrase, “When in doubt, tell the\\r\\n          truth.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHAIRMAN, Mr. PUTZEL, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE FREUNDSCHAFT,—That maxim\\r\\nI did invent, but never expected it to be applied to me. I did say,\\r\\n“When you are in doubt,” but when I am in doubt myself I use more\\r\\nsagacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Grout suggested that if I have anything to say against Mr. Putzel,\\r\\nor any criticism of his career or his character, I am the last person to\\r\\ncome out on account of that maxim and tell the truth. That is altogether\\r\\na mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do think it is right for other people to be virtuous so that they can\\r\\nbe happy hereafter, but if I knew every impropriety that even Mr. Putzel\\r\\nhas committed in his life, I would not mention one of them. My judgment\\r\\nhas been maturing for seventy years, and I have got to that point where\\r\\nI know better than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Putzel stands related to me in a very tender way (through the tax\\r\\noffice), and it does not behoove me to say anything which could by any\\r\\npossibility militate against that condition of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, that word—taxes, taxes, taxes! I have heard it to-night. I have\\r\\nheard it all night. I wish somebody would change that subject; that is a\\r\\nvery sore subject to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so relieved when judge Leventritt did find something that was not\\r\\ntaxable—when he said that the commissioner could not tax your patience.\\r\\nAnd that comforted me. We’ve got so much taxation. I don’t know of\\r\\na single foreign product that enters this country untaxed except the\\r\\nanswer to prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn an occasion like this the proprieties require that you merely pay\\r\\ncompliments to the guest of the occasion, and I am merely here to pay\\r\\ncompliments to the guest of the occasion, not to criticise him in any\\r\\nway, and I can say only complimentary things to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I went down to the tax office some time ago, for the first time\\r\\nin New York, I saw Mr. Putzel sitting in the “Seat of Perjury.” I\\r\\nrecognized him right away. I warmed to him on the spot. I didn’t\\r\\nknow that I had ever seen him before, but just as soon as I saw him I\\r\\nrecognized him. I had met him twenty-five years before, and at that time\\r\\nhad achieved a knowledge of his abilities and something more than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought: “Now, this is the man whom I saw twenty-five years ago.”\\r\\n On that occasion I not only went free at his hands, but carried off\\r\\nsomething more than that. I hoped it would happen again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was twenty-five years ago when I saw a young clerk in Putnam’s\\r\\nbookstore. I went in there and asked for George Haven Putnam, and handed\\r\\nhim my card, and then the young man said Mr. Putnam was busy and I\\r\\ncouldn’t see him. Well, I had merely called in a social way, and so it\\r\\ndidn’t matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was going out when I saw a great big, fat, interesting-looking book\\r\\nlying there, and I took it up. It was an account of the invasion\\r\\nof England in the fourteenth century by the Preaching Friar, and it\\r\\ninterested me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked him the price of it, and he said four dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” I said, “what discount do you allow to publishers?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said: “Forty percent. off.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI said: “All right, I am a publisher.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put down the figure, forty per cent. off, on a card.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I said: “What discount do you allow to authors?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said: “Forty per cent. off.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” I said, “set me down as an author.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now,” said I, “what discount do you allow to the clergy?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said: “Forty per cent. off.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI said to him that I was only on the road, and that I was studying for\\r\\nthe ministry. I asked him wouldn’t he knock off twenty per cent. for\\r\\nthat. He set down the figure, and he never smiled once.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was working off these humorous brilliancies on him and getting no\\r\\nreturn—not a scintillation in his eye, not a spark of recognition of\\r\\nwhat I was doing there. I was almost in despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought I might try him once more, so I said “Now, I am also a member\\r\\nof the human race. Will you let me have the ten per cent. off for that?”\\r\\n He set it down, and never smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I gave it up. I said: “There is my card with my address on it,\\r\\nbut I have not any money with me. Will you please send the bill to\\r\\nHartford?” I took up the book and was going away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said: “Wait a minute. There is forty cents coming to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I met him in the tax office I thought maybe I could make something\\r\\nagain, but I could not. But I had not any idea I could when I came, and\\r\\nas it turned out I did get off entirely free.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put up my hand and made a statement. It gave me a good deal of pain\\r\\nto do that. I was not used to it. I was born and reared in the higher\\r\\ncircles of Missouri, and there we don’t do such things—didn’t in my\\r\\ntime, but we have got that little matter settled—got a sort of tax\\r\\nlevied on me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he touched me. Yes, he touched me this time, because he\\r\\ncried—cried! He was moved to tears to see that I, a virtuous person only\\r\\na year before, after immersion for one year—during one year in the New\\r\\nYork morals—had no more conscience than a millionaire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DAY WE CELEBRATE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT THE FOURTH-OF-JULY DINNER OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY,\\r\\n          LONDON, 1899.\\r\\n\\r\\nI noticed in Ambassador Choate’s speech that he said: “You may be\\r\\nAmericans or Englishmen, but you cannot be both at the same time.” You\\r\\nresponded by applause.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider the effect of a short residence here. I find the Ambassador\\r\\nrises first to speak to a toast, followed by a Senator, and I come\\r\\nthird. What a subtle tribute that to monarchial influence of the country\\r\\nwhen you place rank above respectability!\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born modest, and if I had not been things like this would force it\\r\\nupon me. I understand it quite well. I am here to see that between them\\r\\nthey do justice to the day we celebrate, and in case they do not I must\\r\\ndo it myself. But I notice they have considered this day merely from one\\r\\nside—its sentimental, patriotic, poetic side. But it has another side.\\r\\nIt has a commercial, a business side that needs reforming. It has a\\r\\nhistorical side.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not say “an” historical side, because I am speaking the American\\r\\nlanguage. I do not see why our cousins should continue to say “an”\\r\\n hospital, “an” historical fact, “an” horse. It seems to me the Congress\\r\\nof Women, now in session, should look to it. I think “an” is having a\\r\\nlittle too much to do with it. It comes of habit, which accounts for\\r\\nmany things.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday, for example, I was at a luncheon party. At the end of the\\r\\nparty a great dignitary of the English Established Church went away half\\r\\nan hour before anybody else and carried off my hat. Now, that was an\\r\\ninnocent act on his part. He went out first, and of course had the\\r\\nchoice of hats. As a rule I try to get out first myself. But I hold that\\r\\nit was an innocent, unconscious act, due, perhaps, to heredity. He\\r\\nwas thinking about ecclesiastical matters, and when a man is in that\\r\\ncondition of mind he will take anybody’s hat. The result was that the\\r\\nwhole afternoon I was under the influence of his clerical hat and could\\r\\nnot tell a lie. Of course, he was hard at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a compliment to both of us. His hat fitted me exactly; my hat\\r\\nfitted him exactly. So I judge I was born to rise to high dignity in the\\r\\nChurch some how or other, but I do not know what he was born for. That\\r\\nis an illustration of the influence of habit, and it is perceptible here\\r\\nwhen they say “an” hospital, “an” European, “an” historical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe business aspects of the Fourth of July is not perfect as it stands.\\r\\nSee what it costs us every year with loss of life, the crippling of\\r\\nthousands with its fireworks, and the burning down of property. It is\\r\\nnot only sacred to patriotism and universal freedom, but to the surgeon,\\r\\nthe undertaker, the insurance offices—and they are working it for all it\\r\\nis worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am pleased to see that we have a cessation of war for the time. This\\r\\ncoming from me, a soldier, you will appreciate. I was a soldier in the\\r\\nSouthern war for two weeks, and when gentlemen get up to speak of the\\r\\ngreat deeds our army and navy have recently done, why, it goes all\\r\\nthrough me and fires up the old war spirit. I had in my first engagement\\r\\nthree horses shot under me. The next ones went over my head, the next\\r\\nhit me in the back. Then I retired to meet an engagement.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thank you, gentlemen, for making even a slight reference to the war\\r\\nprofession, in which I distinguished myself, short as my career was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINDEPENDENCE DAY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          The American Society in London gave a banquet, July 4, 1907, at\\r\\n          the Hotel Cecil.  Ambassador Choate called on Mr. Clemens to\\r\\n          respond to the toast “The Day We Celebrate.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHAIRMAN, MY LORD, AND GENTLEMEN,—Once more it happens, as it has\\r\\nhappened so often since I arrived in England a week or two ago,\\r\\nthat instead of celebrating the Fourth of July properly as has been\\r\\nindicated, I have to first take care of my personal character. Sir\\r\\nMortimer Durand still remains unconvinced. Well, I tried to convince\\r\\nthese people from the beginning that I did not take the Ascot Cup; and\\r\\nas I have failed to convince anybody that I did not take the cup, I\\r\\nmight as well confess I did take it and be done with it. I don’t see why\\r\\nthis uncharitable feeling should follow me everywhere, and why I should\\r\\nhave that crime thrown up to me on all occasions. The tears that I have\\r\\nwept over it ought to have created a different feeling than this—and,\\r\\nbesides, I don’t think it is very right or fair that, considering\\r\\nEngland has been trying to take a cup of ours for forty years—I don’t\\r\\nsee why they should take so much trouble when I tried to go into the\\r\\nbusiness myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Mortimer Durand, too, has had trouble from going to a dinner here,\\r\\nand he has told you what he suffered in consequence. But what did he\\r\\nsuffer? He only missed his train, and one night of discomfort, and\\r\\nhe remembers it to this day. Oh! if you could only think what I have\\r\\nsuffered from a similar circumstance. Two or three years ago, in New\\r\\nYork, with that Society there which is made up of people from all\\r\\nBritish Colonies, and from Great Britain generally, who were educated in\\r\\nBritish colleges and British schools, I was there to respond to a toast\\r\\nof some kind or other, and I did then what I have been in the habit of\\r\\ndoing, from a selfish motive, for a long time, and that is, I got myself\\r\\nplaced No, 3 in the list of speakers—then you get home early.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to go five miles up-river, and had to catch a particular train or\\r\\nnot get there. But see the magnanimity which is born in me, which I have\\r\\ncultivated all my life. A very famous and very great British clergyman\\r\\ncame to me presently, and he said: “I am away down in the list; I have\\r\\ngot to catch a certain train this Saturday night; if I don’t catch that\\r\\ntrain I shall be carried beyond midnight and break the Sabbath. Won’t\\r\\nyou change places with me?” I said: “Certainly I will.” I did it at\\r\\nonce. Now, see what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalk about Sir Mortimer Durand’s sufferings for a single night! I have\\r\\nsuffered ever since because I saved that gentleman from breaking the\\r\\nSabbath-yes, saved him. I took his place, but I lost my train, and it\\r\\nwas I who broke the Sabbath. Up to that time I never had broken the\\r\\nSabbath in my life, and from that day to this I never have kept it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! I am learning much here to-night. I find I didn’t know anything\\r\\nabout the American Society—that is, I didn’t know its chief virtue.\\r\\nI didn’t know its chief virtue until his Excellency our Ambassador\\r\\nrevealed it—I may say, exposed it. I was intending to go home on the\\r\\n13th of this month, but I look upon that in a different light now. I am\\r\\ngoing to stay here until the American Society pays my passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Ambassador has spoken of our Fourth of July and the noise it makes.\\r\\nWe have got a double Fourth of July—a daylight Fourth and a midnight\\r\\nFourth. During the day in America, as our Ambassador has indicated, we\\r\\nkeep the Fourth of July properly in a reverent spirit. We devote it to\\r\\nteaching our children patriotic things—reverence for the Declaration of\\r\\nIndependence. We honor the day all through the daylight hours, and\\r\\nwhen night comes we dishonor it. Presently—before long—they are getting\\r\\nnearly ready to begin now—on the Atlantic coast, when night shuts down,\\r\\nthat pandemonium will begin, and there will be noise, and noise, and\\r\\nnoise—all night long—and there will be more than noise there will be\\r\\npeople crippled, there will be people killed, there will be people who\\r\\nwill lose their eyes, and all through that permission which we give\\r\\nto irresponsible boys to play with firearms and fire-crackers, and all\\r\\nsorts of dangerous things: We turn that Fourth of July, alas! over\\r\\nto rowdies to drink and get drunk and make the night hideous, and we\\r\\ncripple and kill more people than you would imagine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe probably began to celebrate our Fourth-of-July night in that way one\\r\\nhundred and twenty-five years ago, and on every Fourth-of-July night\\r\\nsince these horrors have grown and grown, until now, in our five\\r\\nthousand towns of America, somebody gets killed or crippled on every\\r\\nFourth-of-July night, besides those cases of sick persons whom we never\\r\\nhear of, who die as the result of the noise or the shock. They cripple\\r\\nand kill more people on the Fourth of July in America than they kill and\\r\\ncripple in our wars nowadays, and there are no pensions for these folk.\\r\\nAnd, too, we burn houses. Really we destroy more property on every\\r\\nFourth-of-July night than the whole of the United States was worth one\\r\\nhundred and twenty-five years ago. Really our Fourth of July is our\\r\\nday of mourning, our day of sorrow. Fifty thousand people who have lost\\r\\nfriends, or who have had friends crippled, receive that Fourth of July,\\r\\nwhen it comes, as a day of mourning for the losses they have sustained\\r\\nin their families.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have suffered in that way myself. I have had relatives killed in that\\r\\nway. One was in Chicago years ago—an uncle of mine, just as good an\\r\\nuncle as I have ever had, and I had lots of them—yes, uncles to burn,\\r\\nuncles to spare. This poor uncle, full of patriotism, opened his mouth\\r\\nto hurrah, and a rocket went down his throat. Before that man could ask\\r\\nfor a drink of water to quench that thing, it blew up and scattered him\\r\\nall over the forty-five States, and—really, now, this is true—I know\\r\\nabout it myself—twenty-four hours after that it was raining buttons,\\r\\nrecognizable as his, on the Atlantic seaboard. A person cannot have a\\r\\ndisaster like that and be entirely cheerful the rest of his life. I had\\r\\nanother uncle, on an entirely different Fourth of July, who was blown up\\r\\nthat way, and really it trimmed him as it would a tree. He had hardly a\\r\\nlimb left on him anywhere. All we have left now is an expurgated edition\\r\\nof that uncle. But never mind about these things; they are merely\\r\\npassing matters. Don’t let me make you sad.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Mortimer Durand said that you, the English people, gave up your\\r\\ncolonies over there—got tired of them—and did it with reluctance. Now I\\r\\nwish you just to consider that he was right about that, and that he had\\r\\nhis reasons for saying that England did not look upon our Revolution as\\r\\na foreign war, but as a civil war fought by Englishmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Fourth of July which we honor so much, and which we love so much,\\r\\nand which we take so much pride in, is an English institution, not an\\r\\nAmerican one, and it comes of a great ancestry. The first Fourth of July\\r\\nin that noble genealogy dates back seven centuries lacking eight years.\\r\\nThat is the day of the Great Charter—the Magna Charta—which was born at\\r\\nRunnymede in the next to the last year of King John, and portions of the\\r\\nliberties secured thus by those hardy Barons from that reluctant King\\r\\nJohn are a part of our Declaration of Independence, of our Fourth of\\r\\nJuly, of our American liberties. And the second of those Fourths of July\\r\\nwas not born until four centuries later, in, Charles the First’s time,\\r\\nin the Bill of Rights, and that is ours, that is part of our liberties.\\r\\nThe next one was still English, in New England, where they established\\r\\nthat principle which remains with us to this day, and will continue to\\r\\nremain with us—no taxation without representation. That is always going\\r\\nto stand, and that the English Colonies in New England gave us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fourth of July, and the one which you are celebrating now, born, in\\r\\nPhiladelphia on the 4th of July, 1776—that is English, too. It is not\\r\\nAmerican. Those were English colonists, subjects of King George III.,\\r\\nEnglishmen at heart, who protested against the oppressions of the Home\\r\\nGovernment. Though they proposed to cure those oppressions and remove\\r\\nthem, still remaining under the Crown, they were not intending a\\r\\nrevolution. The revolution was brought about by circumstances which\\r\\nthey could not control. The Declaration of Independence was written by\\r\\na British subject, every name signed to it was the name of a British\\r\\nsubject. There was not the name of a single American attached to the\\r\\nDeclaration of Independence—in fact, there was not an American in the\\r\\ncountry in that day except the Indians out on the plains. They were\\r\\nEnglishmen, all Englishmen—Americans did not begin until seven years\\r\\nlater, when that Fourth of July had become seven years old, and then,\\r\\nthe American Republic was established. Since then, there have been\\r\\nAmericans. So you see what we owe to England in the matter of liberties.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have, however, one Fourth of July which is absolutely our own, and\\r\\nthat is that great proclamation issued forty years ago by that great\\r\\nAmerican to whom Sir Mortimer Durand paid that just and beautiful\\r\\ntribute—Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln’s proclamation, which not only set the\\r\\nblack slaves free, but set the white man free also. The owner was set\\r\\nfree from the burden and offence, that sad condition of things where he\\r\\nwas in so many instances a master and owner of slaves when he did not\\r\\nwant to be. That proclamation set them all free. But even in this matter\\r\\nEngland suggested it, for England had set her slaves free thirty years\\r\\nbefore, and we followed her example. We always followed her example,\\r\\nwhether it was good or bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was an English judge that issued that other great proclamation,\\r\\nand established that great principle that, when a slave, let him belong\\r\\nto whom he may, and let him come whence he may, sets his foot upon\\r\\nEnglish soil, his fetters by that act fall away and he is a free man\\r\\nbefore the world. We followed the example of 1833, and we freed our\\r\\nslaves as I have said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true, then, that all our Fourths of July, and we have five of\\r\\nthem, England gave to us, except that one that I have mentioned—the\\r\\nEmancipation Proclamation, and, lest we forget, let us all remember that\\r\\nwe owe these things to England. Let us be able to say to Old England,\\r\\nthis great-hearted, venerable old mother of the race, you gave us our\\r\\nFourths of July that we love and that we honor and revere, you gave us\\r\\nthe Declaration of Independence, which is the Charter of our rights,\\r\\nyou, the venerable Mother of Liberties, the Protector of Anglo-Saxon\\r\\nFreedom—you gave us these things, and we do most honestly thank you for\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAMERICANS AND THE ENGLISH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     ADDRESS AT A GATHERING OF AMERICANS IN LONDON, JULY 4, 1872\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,—I thank you for the compliment\\r\\nwhich has just been tendered me, and to show my appreciation of it I\\r\\nwill not afflict you with many words. It is pleasant to celebrate in\\r\\nthis peaceful way, upon this old mother soil, the anniversary of an\\r\\nexperiment which was born of war with this same land so long ago, and\\r\\nwrought out to a successful issue by the devotion of our ancestors. It\\r\\nhas taken nearly a hundred years to bring the English and Americans into\\r\\nkindly and mutually appreciative relations, but I believe it has\\r\\nbeen accomplished at last. It was a great step when the two last\\r\\nmisunderstandings were settled by arbitration instead of cannon. It\\r\\nis another great step when England adopts our sewing-machines without\\r\\nclaiming the invention—as usual. It was another when they imported one\\r\\nof our sleeping-cars the other day. And it warmed my heart more than\\r\\nI can tell, yesterday, when I witnessed the spectacle of an Englishman\\r\\nordering an American sherry cobbler of his own free will and accord—and\\r\\nnot only that but with a great brain and a level head reminding the\\r\\nbarkeeper not to forget the strawberries. With a common origin, a common\\r\\nlanguage, a common literature, a common religion, and—common drinks,\\r\\nwhat is longer needful to the cementing of the two nations together in a\\r\\npermanent bond of brotherhood?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an age of progress, and ours is a progressive land. A great and\\r\\nglorious land, too—a land which has developed a Washington, a Franklin,\\r\\na Wm. M. Tweed, a Longfellow, a Motley, a Jay Gould, a Samuel C.\\r\\nPomeroy, a recent Congress which has never had its equal (in some\\r\\nrespects), and a United States Army which conquered sixty Indians in\\r\\neight months by tiring them out which is much better than uncivilized\\r\\nslaughter, God knows. We have a criminal jury system which is superior\\r\\nto any in the world; and its efficiency is only marred by the difficulty\\r\\nof finding twelve men every day who don’t know anything and can’t read.\\r\\nAnd I may observe that we have an insanity plea that would have\\r\\nsaved Cain. I think I can say, and say with pride, that we have some\\r\\nlegislatures that bring higher prices than any in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI refer with effusion to our railway system, which consents to let\\r\\nus live, though it might do the opposite, being our owners. It only\\r\\ndestroyed three thousand and seventy lives last year by collisions, and\\r\\ntwenty-seven thousand two hundred and sixty by running over heedless and\\r\\nunnecessary people at crossings. The companies seriously regretted the\\r\\nkilling of these thirty thousand people, and went so far as to pay for\\r\\nsome of them—voluntarily, of course, for the meanest of us would not\\r\\nclaim that we possess a court treacherous enough to enforce a law\\r\\nagainst a railway company. But, thank Heaven, the railway companies are\\r\\ngenerally disposed to do the right and kindly thing without compulsion.\\r\\nI know of an instance which greatly touched me at the time. After\\r\\nan accident the company sent home the remains of a dear distant old\\r\\nrelative of mine in a basket, with the remark, “Please state what figure\\r\\nyou hold him at—and return the basket.” Now there couldn’t be anything\\r\\nfriendlier than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I must not stand here and brag all night. However, you won’t mind a\\r\\nbody bragging a little about his country on the Fourth of July. It is a\\r\\nfair and legitimate time to fly the eagle. I will say only one more\\r\\nword of brag—and a hopeful one. It is this. We have a form of government\\r\\nwhich gives each man a fair chance and no favor. With us no individual\\r\\nis born with a right to look down upon his neighbor and hold him in\\r\\ncontempt. Let such of us as are not dukes find our consolation in that.\\r\\nAnd we may find hope for the future in the fact that as unhappy as is\\r\\nthe condition of our political morality to-day, England has risen up out\\r\\nof a far fouler since the days when Charles I. ennobled courtesans and\\r\\nall political place was a matter of bargain and sale. There is hope for\\r\\nus yet.*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          *At least the above is the speech which I was going to make,\\r\\n          but our minister, General Schenck, presided, and after the\\r\\n          blessing, got up and made a great, long, inconceivably dull\\r\\n          harangue, and wound up by saying that inasmuch as speech-making\\r\\n          did not seem to exhilarate the guests much, all further oratory\\r\\n          would be dispensed with during the evening, and we could just\\r\\n          sit and talk privately to our elbow-neighbors and have a good,\\r\\n          sociable time.  It is known that in consequence of that remark\\r\\n          forty-four perfected speeches died in the womb.  The\\r\\n          depression, the gloom, the solemnity that reigned over the\\r\\n          banquet from that time forth will be a lasting memory with many\\r\\n          that were there.  By that one thoughtless remark General\\r\\n          Schenck lost forty-four of the best friends he had in England.\\r\\n          More than one said that night: “And this is the sort of person\\r\\n          that is sent to represent us in a great sister empire!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nABOUT LONDON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT A DINNER GIVEN BY THE SAVAGE CLUB,\\r\\n          LONDON, SEPTEMBER 28, 1872.\\r\\n\\r\\n          Reported by Moncure D. Conway in the Cincinnati Commercial.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt affords me sincere pleasure to meet this distinguished club, a club\\r\\nwhich has extended its hospitalities and its cordial welcome to so many\\r\\nof my countrymen. I hope [and here the speaker’s voice became low and\\r\\nfluttering] you will excuse these clothes. I am going to the theatre;\\r\\nthat will explain these clothes. I have other clothes than these.\\r\\nJudging human nature by what I have seen of it, I suppose that the\\r\\ncustomary thing for a stranger to do when he stands here is to make a\\r\\npun on the name of this club, under the impression, of course, that he\\r\\nis the first man that that idea has occurred to. It is a credit to our\\r\\nhuman nature, not a blemish upon it; for it shows that underlying all\\r\\nour depravity (and God knows and you know we are depraved enough) and\\r\\nall our sophistication, and untarnished by them, there is a sweet germ\\r\\nof innocence and simplicity still. When a stranger says to me, with\\r\\na glow of inspiration in his eye, some gentle, innocuous little thing\\r\\nabout “Twain and one flesh,” and all that sort of thing, I don’t try to\\r\\ncrush that man into the earth—no. I feel like saying: “Let me take you\\r\\nby the hand, sir; let me embrace you; I have not heard that pun for\\r\\nweeks.” We will deal in palpable puns. We will call parties named King\\r\\n“Your Majesty,” and we will say to the Smiths that we think we have\\r\\nheard that name before somewhere. Such is human nature. We cannot alter\\r\\nthis. It is God that made us so for some good and wise purpose. Let us\\r\\nnot repine. But though I may seem strange, may seem eccentric, I mean to\\r\\nrefrain from punning upon the name of this club, though I could make a\\r\\nvery good one if I had time to think about it—a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot express to you what entire enjoyment I find in this first visit\\r\\nto this prodigious metropolis of yours. Its wonders seem to me to be\\r\\nlimitless. I go about as in a dream—as in a realm of enchantment—where\\r\\nmany things are rare and beautiful, and all things are strange and\\r\\nmarvellous. Hour after hour I stand—I stand spellbound, as it were—and\\r\\ngaze upon the statuary in Leicester Square. [Leicester Square being a\\r\\nhorrible chaos, with the relic of an equestrian statue in the centre,\\r\\nthe king being headless and limbless, and the horse in little better\\r\\ncondition.] I visit the mortuary effigies of noble old Henry VIII., and\\r\\nJudge Jeffreys, and the preserved gorilla, and try to make up my mind\\r\\nwhich of my ancestors I admire the most. I go to that matchless Hyde\\r\\nPark and drive all around it, and then I start to enter it at the Marble\\r\\nArch—-and—am induced to “change my mind.” [Cabs are not permitted in\\r\\nHyde Park—nothing less aristocratic than a private carriage.] It is a\\r\\ngreat benefaction—is Hyde Park. There, in his hansom cab, the invalid\\r\\ncan go—the poor, sad child of misfortune—and insert his nose between the\\r\\nrailings, and breathe the pure, health-giving air of the country and of\\r\\nheaven. And if he is a swell invalid, who isn’t obliged to depend upon\\r\\nparks for his country air, he can drive inside—if he owns his vehicle.\\r\\nI drive round and round Hyde Park, and the more I see of the edges of it\\r\\nthe more grateful I am that the margin is extensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I have been to the Zoological Gardens. What a wonderful place that\\r\\nis! I never have seen such a curious and interesting variety of wild\\r\\nanimals in any garden before—except “Mabilie.” I never believed before\\r\\nthere were so many different kinds of animals in the world as you\\r\\ncan find there—and I don’t believe it yet. I have been to the British\\r\\nMuseum. I would advise you to drop in there some time when you have\\r\\nnothing to do for—five minutes—if you have never been there: It seems\\r\\nto me the noblest monument that this nation has yet erected to her\\r\\ngreatness. I say to her, our greatness—as a nation. True, she has built\\r\\nother monuments, and stately ones, as well; but these she has uplifted\\r\\nin honor of two or three colossal demigods who have stalked across the\\r\\nworld’s stage, destroying tyrants and delivering nations, and whose\\r\\nprodigies will still live in the memories of men ages after their\\r\\nmonuments shall have crumbled to dust—I refer to the Wellington and\\r\\nNelson monuments, and—the Albert memorial. [Sarcasm. The Albert memorial\\r\\nis the finest monument in the world, and celebrates the existence of as\\r\\ncommonplace a person as good luck ever lifted out of obscurity.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe library at the British Museum I find particularly astounding. I have\\r\\nread there hours together, and hardly made an impression on it. I revere\\r\\nthat library. It is the author’s friend. I don’t care how mean a book\\r\\nis, it always takes one copy. [A copy of every book printed in Great\\r\\nBritain must by law be sent to the British Museum, a law much complained\\r\\nof by publishers.] And then every day that author goes there to gaze\\r\\nat that book, and is encouraged to go on in the good work. And what a\\r\\ntouching sight it is of a Saturday afternoon to see the poor, careworn\\r\\nclergymen gathered together in that vast reading-room cabbaging sermons\\r\\nfor Sunday. You will pardon my referring to these things.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything in this monster city interests me, and I cannot keep from\\r\\ntalking, even at the risk of being instructive. People here seem always\\r\\nto express distances by parables. To a stranger it is just a little\\r\\nconfusing to be so parabolic—so to speak. I collar a citizen, and I\\r\\nthink I am going to get some valuable information out of him. I ask him\\r\\nhow far it is to Birmingham, and he says it is twenty-one shillings and\\r\\nsixpence. Now we know that doesn’t help a man who is trying to learn.\\r\\nI find myself down-town somewhere, and I want to get some sort of idea\\r\\nwhere I am—being usually lost when alone—and I stop a citizen and say:\\r\\n“How far is it to Charing Cross?” “Shilling fare in a cab,” and off\\r\\nhe goes. I suppose if I were to ask a Londoner how far it is from the\\r\\nsublime to the ridiculous, he would try to express it in coin. But I\\r\\nam trespassing upon your time with these geological statistics and\\r\\nhistorical reflections. I will not longer keep you from your orgies.\\r\\n‘Tis a real pleasure for me to be here, and I thank you for it. The name\\r\\nof the Savage Club is associated in my mind with the kindly interest and\\r\\nthe friendly offices which you lavished upon an old friend of mine who\\r\\ncame among you a stranger, and you opened your English hearts to him and\\r\\ngave him welcome and a home—Artemus Ward. Asking that you will join me,\\r\\nI give you his memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCETON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Clemens spent several days in May, 1901, in Princeton, New\\r\\n          Jersey, as the guest of Lawrence Hutton.  He gave a reading one\\r\\n          evening before a large audience composed of university students\\r\\n          and professors.  Before the reading Mr. Clemens said:\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel exceedingly surreptitious in coming down here without an\\r\\nannouncement of any kind. I do not want to see any advertisements\\r\\naround, for the reason that I’m not a lecturer any longer. I reformed\\r\\nlong ago, and I break over and commit this sin only just one time this\\r\\nyear: and that is moderate, I think, for a person of my disposition. It\\r\\nis not my purpose to lecture any more as long as I live. I never intend\\r\\nto stand up on a platform any more—unless by the request of a sheriff or\\r\\nsomething like that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ST. LOUIS HARBOR-BOAT “MARK TWAIN”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          The Countess de Rochambeau christened the St. Louis harbor-boat\\r\\n          ‘Mark Twain’ in honor of Mr. Clemens, June 6, 1902.  Just\\r\\n          before the luncheon he acted as pilot.\\r\\n\\r\\n          “Lower away lead!” boomed out the voice of the pilot.\\r\\n\\r\\n          “Mark twain, quarter five and one-half-six feet!” replied the\\r\\n          leadsman below.\\r\\n\\r\\n          “You are all dead safe as long as I have the wheel--but this is\\r\\n          my last time at the wheel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n          At the luncheon Mr. Clemens made a short address.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all, no—second of all—I wish to offer my thanks for the honor\\r\\ndone me by naming this last rose of summer of the Mississippi Valley for\\r\\nme, this boat which represents a perished interest, which I fortified\\r\\nlong ago, but did not save its life. And, in the first place, I wish\\r\\nto thank the Countess de Rochambeau for the honor she has done me in\\r\\npresiding at this christening.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that it is peculiarly appropriate that I should be allowed the\\r\\nprivilege of joining my voice with the general voice of St. Louis and\\r\\nMissouri in welcoming to the Mississippi Valley and this part of the\\r\\ncontinent these illustrious visitors from France.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen La Salle came down this river a century and a quarter ago there was\\r\\nnothing on its banks but savages. He opened up this great river, and by\\r\\nhis simple act was gathered in this great Louisiana territory. I would\\r\\nhave done it myself for half the money.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n          ADDRESS AT A DINNER GIVEN BY COLONEL GEORGE HARVEY AT\\r\\n          DELMONICO’S, DECEMBER 5, 1905, TO CELEBRATE THE SEVENTIETH\\r\\n          ANNIVERSARY OF MR. CLEMENS’ BIRTH\\r\\n\\r\\n          Mr. Howells introduced Mr. Clemens:\\r\\n\\r\\n          “Now, ladies and gentlemen, and Colonel Harvey, I will try not\\r\\n          to be greedy on your behalf in wishing the health of our\\r\\n          honored and, in view of his great age, our revered guest.  I\\r\\n          will not say, ‘Oh King, live forever!’ but ‘Oh King, live as\\r\\n          long as you like!’” [Amid great applause and waving of napkins\\r\\n          all rise and drink to Mark Twain.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, if I made that joke, it is the best one I ever made, and it is in\\r\\nthe prettiest language, too.—I never can get quite to that height. But\\r\\nI appreciate that joke, and I shall remember it—and I shall use it when\\r\\noccasion requires.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had a great many birthdays in my time. I remember the first one\\r\\nvery well, and I always think of it with indignation; everything was\\r\\nso crude, unaesthetic, primeval. Nothing like this at all. No proper\\r\\nappreciative preparation made; nothing really ready. Now, for a person\\r\\nborn with high and delicate instincts—why, even the cradle wasn’t\\r\\nwhitewashed—nothing ready at all. I hadn’t any hair, I hadn’t any teeth,\\r\\nI hadn’t any clothes, I had to go to my first banquet just like that.\\r\\nWell, everybody came swarming in. It was the merest little bit of a\\r\\nvillage—hardly that, just a little hamlet, in the backwoods of Missouri,\\r\\nwhere nothing ever happened, and the people were all interested, and\\r\\nthey all came; they looked me over to see if there was anything fresh\\r\\nin my line. Why, nothing ever happened in that village—I—why, I was\\r\\nthe only thing that had really happened there for months and months and\\r\\nmonths; and although I say it myself that shouldn’t, I came the nearest\\r\\nto being a real event that had happened in that village in more than two\\r\\nyears. Well, those people came, they came with that curiosity which is\\r\\nso provincial, with that frankness which also is so provincial, and they\\r\\nexamined me all around and gave their opinion. Nobody asked them, and\\r\\nI shouldn’t have minded if anybody had paid me a compliment, but nobody\\r\\ndid. Their opinions were all just green with prejudice, and I feel those\\r\\nopinions to this day. Well, I stood that as long as—well, you know I\\r\\nwas born courteous, and I stood it to the limit. I stood it an hour,\\r\\nand then the worm turned. I was the worm; it was my turn to turn, and I\\r\\nturned. I knew very well the strength of my position; I knew that I was\\r\\nthe only spotlessly pure and innocent person in that whole town, and\\r\\nI came out and said so: And they could not say a word. It was so\\r\\ntrue: They blushed; they were embarrassed. Well, that was the first\\r\\nafter-dinner speech I ever made: I think it was after dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a long stretch between that first birthday speech and this one.\\r\\nThat was my cradle-song; and this is my swan-song, I suppose. I am used\\r\\nto swan-songs; I have sung them several times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is my seventieth birthday, and I wonder if you all rise to the\\r\\nsize of that proposition, realizing all the significance of that phrase,\\r\\nseventieth birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seventieth birthday! It is the time of life when you arrive at a new\\r\\nand awful dignity; when you may throw aside the decent reserves which\\r\\nhave oppressed you for a generation and stand unafraid and unabashed\\r\\nupon your seven-terraced summit and look down and teach—unrebuked. You\\r\\ncan tell the world how you got there. It is what they all do. You shall\\r\\nnever get tired of telling by what delicate arts and deep moralities you\\r\\nclimbed up to that great place. You will explain the process and dwell\\r\\non the particulars with senile rapture. I have been anxious to explain\\r\\nmy own system this long time, and now at last I have the right.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have achieved my seventy years in the usual way: by sticking strictly\\r\\nto a scheme of life which would kill anybody else. It sounds like an\\r\\nexaggeration, but that is really the common rule for attaining to old\\r\\nage. When we examine the programme of any of these garrulous old people\\r\\nwe always find that the habits which have preserved them would have\\r\\ndecayed us; that the way of life which enabled them to live upon the\\r\\nproperty of their heirs so long, as Mr. Choate says, would have put us\\r\\nout of commission ahead of time. I will offer here, as a sound maxim,\\r\\nthis: That we can’t reach old age by another man’s road.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now teach, offering my way of life to whomsoever desires to\\r\\ncommit suicide by the scheme which has enabled me to beat the doctor and\\r\\nthe hangman for seventy years. Some of the details may sound untrue, but\\r\\nthey are not. I am not here to deceive; I am here to teach.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have no permanent habits until we are forty. Then they begin to\\r\\nharden, presently they petrify, then business begins. Since forty I have\\r\\nbeen regular about going to bed and getting up—and that is one of\\r\\nthe main things. I have made it a rule to go to bed when there wasn’t\\r\\nanybody left to sit up with; and I have made it a rule to get up when I\\r\\nhad to. This has resulted in an unswerving regularity of irregularity.\\r\\nIt has saved me sound, but it would injure another person.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the matter of diet—which is another main thing—I have been\\r\\npersistently strict in sticking to the things which didn’t agree with me\\r\\nuntil one or the other of us got the best of it. Until lately I got the\\r\\nbest of it myself. But last spring I stopped frolicking with mince-pie\\r\\nafter midnight; up to then I had always believed it wasn’t loaded. For\\r\\nthirty years I have taken coffee and bread at eight in the morning, and\\r\\nno bite nor sup until seven-thirty in the evening. Eleven hours. That is\\r\\nall right for me, and is wholesome, because I have never had a headache\\r\\nin my life, but headachy people would not reach seventy comfortably by\\r\\nthat road, and they would be foolish to try it. And I wish to urge upon\\r\\nyou this—which I think is wisdom—that if you find you can’t make seventy\\r\\nby any but an uncomfortable road, don’t you go. When they take off the\\r\\nPullman and retire you to the rancid smoker, put on your things, count\\r\\nyour checks, and get out at the first way station where there’s a\\r\\ncemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have made it a rule never to smoke more than one cigar at a time. I\\r\\nhave no other restriction as regards smoking. I do not know just when\\r\\nI began to smoke, I only know that it was in my father’s lifetime, and\\r\\nthat I was discreet. He passed from this life early in 1847, when I\\r\\nwas a shade past eleven; ever since then I have smoked publicly. As an\\r\\nexample to others, and—not that I care for moderation myself, it has\\r\\nalways been my rule never to smoke when asleep, and never to refrain\\r\\nwhen awake. It is a good rule. I mean, for me; but some of you know\\r\\nquite well that it wouldn’t answer for everybody that’s trying to get to\\r\\nbe seventy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI smoke in bed until I have to go to sleep; I wake up in the night,\\r\\nsometimes once, sometimes twice; sometimes three times, and I never\\r\\nwaste any of these opportunities to smoke. This habit is so old and\\r\\ndear and precious to me that I would feel as you, sir, would feel if you\\r\\nshould lose the only moral you’ve got—meaning the chairman—if you’ve\\r\\ngot one: I am making no charges: I will grant, here, that I have stopped\\r\\nsmoking now and then, for a few months at a time, but it was not on\\r\\nprinciple, it was only to show off; it was to pulverize those critics\\r\\nwho said I was a slave to my habits and couldn’t break my bonds.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-day it is all of sixty years since I began to smoke the limit. I\\r\\nhave never bought cigars with life-belts around them. I early found\\r\\nthat those were too expensive for me: I have always bought cheap\\r\\ncigars—reasonably cheap, at any rate. Sixty years ago they cost me four\\r\\ndollars a barrel, but my taste has improved, latterly, and I pay seven,\\r\\nnow. Six or seven. Seven, I think. Yes; it’s seven. But that includes\\r\\nthe barrel. I often have smoking-parties at my house; but the people\\r\\nthat come have always just taken the pledge. I wonder why that is?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for drinking, I have no rule about that. When the others drink I like\\r\\nto help; otherwise I remain dry, by habit and preference. This dryness\\r\\ndoes not hurt me, but it could easily hurt you, because you are\\r\\ndifferent. You let it alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I was seven years old I have seldom taken a dose of medicine, and\\r\\nhave still seldomer needed one. But up to seven I lived exclusively on\\r\\nallopathic medicines. Not that I needed them, for I don’t think I did;\\r\\nit was for economy; my father took a drug-store for a debt, and it\\r\\nmade cod-liver oil cheaper than the other breakfast foods. We had nine\\r\\nbarrels of it, and it lasted me seven years. Then I was weaned. The rest\\r\\nof the family had to get along with rhubarb and ipecac and such things,\\r\\nbecause I was the pet. I was the first Standard Oil Trust. I had it all.\\r\\nBy the time the drugstore was exhausted my health was established, and\\r\\nthere has never been much the matter with me since. But you know very\\r\\nwell it would be foolish for the average child to start for seventy on\\r\\nthat basis. It happened to be just the thing for me, but that was merely\\r\\nan accident; it couldn’t happen again in a century.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never taken any exercise, except sleeping and resting, and I\\r\\nnever intend to take any. Exercise is loathsome. And it cannot be any\\r\\nbenefit when you are tired; and I was always tired. But let another\\r\\nperson try my way, and see where he will come out. I desire now to\\r\\nrepeat and emphasise that maxim: We can’t reach old age by another man’s\\r\\nroad. My habits protect my life, but they would assassinate you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have lived a severely moral life. But it would be a mistake for other\\r\\npeople to try that, or for me to recommend it. Very few would succeed:\\r\\nyou have to have a perfectly colossal stock of morals; and you can’t get\\r\\nthem on a margin; you have to have the whole thing, and put them in your\\r\\nbox. Morals are an acquirement—like music, like a foreign language, like\\r\\npiety, poker, paralysis—no man is born with them. I wasn’t myself, I\\r\\nstarted poor. I hadn’t a single moral. There is hardly a man in this\\r\\nhouse that is poorer than I was then. Yes, I started like that—the world\\r\\nbefore me, not a moral in the slot. Not even an insurance moral. I can\\r\\nremember the first one I ever got. I can remember the landscape, the\\r\\nweather, the—I can remember how everything looked. It was an old moral,\\r\\nan old second-hand moral, all out of repair, and didn’t fit, anyway. But\\r\\nif you are careful with a thing like that, and keep it in a dry place,\\r\\nand save it for processions, and Chautauquas, and World’s Fairs, and so\\r\\non, and disinfect it now and then, and give it a fresh coat of whitewash\\r\\nonce in a while, you will be surprised to see how well she will last and\\r\\nhow long she will keep sweet, or at least inoffensive. When I got\\r\\nthat mouldy old moral, she had stopped growing, because she hadn’t any\\r\\nexercise; but I worked her hard, I worked her Sundays and all. Under\\r\\nthis cultivation she waxed in might and stature beyond belief, and\\r\\nserved me well and was my pride and joy for sixty-three years; then\\r\\nshe got to associating with insurance presidents, and lost flesh and\\r\\ncharacter, and was a sorrow to look at and no longer competent for\\r\\nbusiness. She was a great loss to me. Yet not all loss. I sold her—ah,\\r\\npathetic skeleton, as she was—I sold her to Leopold, the pirate King of\\r\\nBelgium; he sold her to our Metropolitan Museum, and it was very glad to\\r\\nget her, for without a rag on, she stands 57 feet long and 16 feet high,\\r\\nand they think she’s a brontosaur. Well, she looks it. They believe it\\r\\nwill take nineteen geological periods to breed her match.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorals are of inestimable value, for every man is born crammed with sin\\r\\nmicrobes, and the only thing that can extirpate these sin microbes\\r\\nis morals. Now you take a sterilized Christian—I mean, you take the\\r\\nsterilized Christian, for there’s only one. Dear sir, I wish you\\r\\nwouldn’t look at me like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThreescore years and ten!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the Scriptural statute of limitations. After that, you owe\\r\\nno active duties; for you the strenuous life is over. You are a\\r\\ntime-expired man, to use Kipling’s military phrase: You have served your\\r\\nterm, well or less well, and you are mustered out. You are become an\\r\\nhonorary member of the republic, you are emancipated, compulsions are\\r\\nnot for you, nor any bugle-call but “lights out.” You pay the time-worn\\r\\nduty bills if you choose, or decline if you prefer—and without\\r\\nprejudice—for they are not legally collectable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous-engagement plea, which in forty years has cost you so many\\r\\ntwinges, you can lay aside forever; on this side of the grave you will\\r\\nnever need it again. If you shrink at thought of night, and winter, and\\r\\nthe late home-coming from the banquet and the lights and the laughter\\r\\nthrough the deserted streets—a desolation which would not remind you\\r\\nnow, as for a generation it did, that your friends are sleeping, and you\\r\\nmust creep in a-tiptoe and not disturb them, but would only remind you\\r\\nthat you need not tiptoe, you can never disturb them more—if you shrink\\r\\nat thought of these things, you need only reply, “Your invitation honors\\r\\nme, and pleases me because you still keep me in your remembrance, but I\\r\\nam seventy; seventy, and would nestle in the chimney-corner, and smoke\\r\\nmy pipe, and read my book, and take my rest, wishing you well in all\\r\\naffection; and that when you in your return shall arrive at pier No. 70\\r\\nyou may step aboard your waiting ship with a reconciled spirit, and lay\\r\\nyour course toward the sinking sun with a contented heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Mark Twain’s Speeches by Mark\\r\\nTwain (Samuel Clemens)\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOKSTART OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TWAIN LETTERS, VOL. 5 ***\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by David Widger\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMARK TWAIN’S LETTERS 1901-1906\\r\\n\\r\\nVOLUME V.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Mark Twain\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nARRANGED WITH COMMENT BY ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXL. LETTERS OF 1901, CHIEFLY TO TWICHELL. MARK TWAIN AS A REFORMER.\\r\\nSUMMER AT SARANAC. ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT McKINLEY.\\r\\n\\r\\n     An editorial in the Louisville Courier-Journal, early in 1901, said:\\r\\n     “A remarkable transformation, or rather a development, has taken\\r\\n     place in Mark Twain.  The genial humorist of the earlier day is now\\r\\n     a reformer of the vigorous kind, a sort of knight errant who does\\r\\n     not hesitate to break a lance with either Church or State if he\\r\\n     thinks them interposing on that broad highway over which he believes\\r\\n     not a part but the whole of mankind has the privilege of passing in\\r\\n     the onward march of the ages.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     Mark Twain had begun “breaking the lance” very soon after his return\\r\\n     from Europe.  He did not believe that he could reform the world, but\\r\\n     at least he need not withhold his protest against those things which\\r\\n     stirred his wrath.  He began by causing the arrest of a cabman who\\r\\n     had not only overcharged but insulted him; he continued by writing\\r\\n     openly against the American policy in the Philippines, the\\r\\n     missionary propaganda which had resulted in the Chinese uprising and\\r\\n     massacre, and against Tammany politics.  Not all of his efforts were\\r\\n     in the line of reform; he had become a sort of general spokesman\\r\\n     which the public flocked to hear, whatever the subject.  On the\\r\\n     occasion of a Lincoln Birthday service at Carnegie Hall he was\\r\\n     chosen to preside, and he was obliged to attend more dinners than\\r\\n     were good for his health.  His letters of this period were mainly\\r\\n     written to his old friend Twichell, in Hartford.  Howells, who lived\\r\\n     in New York, he saw with considerable frequency.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In the letter which follows the medicine which Twichell was to take\\r\\n     was Plasmon, an English proprietary remedy in which Mark Twain had\\r\\n     invested--a panacea for all human ills which osteopathy could not\\r\\n     reach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. Joseph Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   14 W. 10TH ST.  Jan.  23, ‘01.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--Certainly. I used to take it in my coffee, but it settled to\\r\\nthe bottom in the form of mud, and I had to eat it with a spoon; so\\r\\nI dropped the custom and took my 2 teaspoonfuls in cold milk after\\r\\nbreakfast. If we were out of milk I shoveled the dry powder into my\\r\\nmouth and washed it down with water. The only essential is to get it\\r\\ndown, the method is not important.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, blame it, I can’t go to the Alumni dinner, Joe. It takes two days,\\r\\nand I can’t spare the time. Moreover I preside at the Lincoln birthday\\r\\ncelebration in Carnegie Hall Feb. 11, and I must not make two speeches\\r\\nso close together. Think of it--two old rebels functioning there--I\\r\\nas President, and Watterson as Orator of the Day! Things have changed\\r\\nsomewhat in these 40 years, thank God.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook here--when you come down you must be our guest--we’ve got a roomy\\r\\nroom for you, and Livy will make trouble if you go elsewhere. Come\\r\\nstraight to 14 West 10th.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 24. Livy says Amen to that; also, can you give us a day or two’s\\r\\nnotice, so the room will be sure to be vacant?\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m going to stick close to my desk for a month, now, hoping to write a\\r\\nsmall book.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Ys Ever\\r\\n                         MARK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The letter which follows is a fair sample of Mark Twain’s private\\r\\n     violence on a subject which, in public print, he could only treat\\r\\n     effectively by preserving his good humor.  When he found it\\r\\n     necessary to boil over, as he did, now and then, for relief, he\\r\\n     always found a willing audience in Twichell.  The mention of his\\r\\n     “Private Philosophy” refers to ‘What Is Man?’, privately published\\r\\n     in 1906; reissued by his publishers in 1916.\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             14  W. 10th Jan.  29, ‘01.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--I’m not expecting anything but kicks for scoffing, and am\\r\\nexpecting a diminution of my bread and butter by it, but if Livy will\\r\\nlet me I will have my say. This nation is like all the others that\\r\\nhave been spewed upon the earth--ready to shout for any cause that will\\r\\ntickle its vanity or fill its pocket. What a hell of a heaven it will\\r\\nbe, when they get all these hypocrites assembled there!\\r\\n\\r\\nI can’t understand it! You are a public guide and teacher, Joe, and are\\r\\nunder a heavy responsibility to men, young and old; if you teach your\\r\\npeople--as you teach me--to hide their opinions when they believe the\\r\\nflag is being abused and dishonored, lest the utterance do them and a\\r\\npublisher a damage, how do you answer for it to your conscience? You\\r\\nare sorry for me; in the fair way of give and take, I am willing to be a\\r\\nlittle sorry for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I seem to be going counter to my own Private Philosophy--which\\r\\nLivy won’t allow me to publish--because it would destroy me. But I hope\\r\\nto see it in print before I die. I planned it 15 years ago, and wrote it\\r\\nin ‘98. I’ve often tried to read it to Livy, but she won’t have it; it\\r\\nmakes her melancholy. The truth always has that effect on people. Would\\r\\nhave, anyway, if they ever got hold of a rag of it--Which they don’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are supposing that I am supposing that I am moved by a Large\\r\\nPatriotism, and that I am distressed because our President has blundered\\r\\nup to his neck in the Philippine mess; and that I am grieved because\\r\\nthis great big ignorant nation, which doesn’t know even the A B C\\r\\nfacts of the Philippine episode, is in disgrace before the sarcastic\\r\\nworld--drop that idea! I care nothing for the rest--I am only distressed\\r\\nand troubled because I am befouled by these things. That is all. When I\\r\\nsearch myself away down deep, I find this out. Whatever a man feels or\\r\\nthinks or does, there is never any but one reason for it--and that is a\\r\\nselfish one.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt great inconvenience, and expense of precious time I went to the chief\\r\\nsynagogue the other night and talked in the interest of a charity school\\r\\nof poor Jew girls. I know--to the finest, shades--the selfish ends that\\r\\nmoved me; but no one else suspects. I could give you the details if I\\r\\nhad time. You would perceive how true they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve written another article; you better hurry down and help Livy\\r\\nsquelch it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe’s out pottering around somewhere, poor housekeeping slave; and Clara\\r\\nis in the hands of the osteopath, getting the bronchitis pulled and\\r\\nhauled out of her. It was a bad attack, and a little disquieting. It\\r\\ncame day before yesterday, and she hasn’t sat up till this afternoon.\\r\\nShe is getting along satisfactorily, now.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Lots of love to you all.\\r\\n                                             MARK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Mark Twain’s religion had to do chiefly with humanity in its present\\r\\n     incarnation, and concerned itself very little with any possible\\r\\n     measure of reward or punishment in some supposed court of the\\r\\n     hereafter.  Nevertheless, psychic investigation always interested\\r\\n     him, and he was good-naturedly willing to explore, even hoping,\\r\\n     perhaps, to be convinced that individuality continues beyond death.\\r\\n     The letter which follows indicates his customary attitude in\\r\\n     relation to spiritualistic research.  The experiments here\\r\\n     mentioned, however, were not satisfactory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mrs. Charles McQuiston:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  DOBBS FERRY, N.

McQUISTON,--I have never had an experience which moved me to\\r\\nbelieve the living can communicate with the dead, but my wife and I have\\r\\nexperimented in the matter when opportunity offered and shall continue\\r\\nto do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enclose a letter which came this morning--the second from the same\\r\\nsource. Mrs. K----is a Missourian, and lately she discovered, by\\r\\naccident, that she was a remarkable hypnotiser. Her best subject is a\\r\\nMissouri girl, Miss White, who is to come here soon and sustain strictly\\r\\nscientific tests before professors at Columbia University. Mrs. Clemens\\r\\nand I intend to be present. And we shall ask the pair to come to our\\r\\nhouse to do whatever things they can do. Meantime, if you thought well\\r\\nof it, you might write her and arrange a meeting, telling her it is by\\r\\nmy suggestion and that I gave you her address.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone has told me that Mrs. Piper is discredited. I cannot be sure,\\r\\nbut I think it was Mr. Myers, President of the London Psychical Research\\r\\nSociety--we heard of his death yesterday. He was a spiritualist. I am\\r\\nafraid he was a very easily convinced man. We visited two mediums whom\\r\\nhe and Andrew Lang considered quite wonderful, but they were quite\\r\\ntransparent frauds.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Clemens corrects me: One of those women was a fraud, the other not\\r\\na fraud, but only an innocent, well-meaning, driveling vacancy.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                                   S.

CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     In Mark Twain’s Bermuda chapters entitled Idle Notes of an Idle\\r\\n     Excursion he tells of an old sea captain, one Hurricane Jones, who\\r\\n     explained biblical miracles in a practical, even if somewhat\\r\\n     startling, fashion.  In his story of the prophets of Baal, for\\r\\n     instance, the old captain declared that the burning water was\\r\\n     nothing more nor less than petroleum.  Upon reading the “notes,”\\r\\n      Professor Phelps of Yale wrote that the same method of explaining\\r\\n     miracles had been offered by Sir Thomas Browne.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Perhaps it may be added that Captain Hurricane Jones also appears in\\r\\n     Roughing It, as Captain Ned Blakely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Professor William Lyon Phelps;\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  YALE UNIVERSITY,\\r\\n                                             NEW YORK, April 24, 1901.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR,--I was not aware that old Sir Thomas had anticipated that\\r\\nstory, and I am much obliged to you for furnishing me the paragraph.\\r\\nIt is curious that the same idea should leave entered two heads so unlike\\r\\nas the head of that wise old philosopher and that of Captain Ned\\r\\nWakeman, a splendidly uncultured old sailor, but in his own opinion a\\r\\nthinker by divine right. He was an old friend of mine of many years’\\r\\nstanding; I made two or three voyages with him, and found him a darling\\r\\nin many ways. The petroleum story was not told to me; he told it to Joe\\r\\nTwichell, who ran across him by accident on a sea voyage where I think\\r\\nthe two were the only passengers. A delicious pair, and admirably mated,\\r\\nthey took to each other at once and became as thick as thieves. Joe was\\r\\npassing under a fictitious name, and old Wakeman didn’t suspect that he\\r\\nwas a parson; so he gave his profanity full swing, and he was a master\\r\\nof that great art. You probably know Twichell, and will know that that\\r\\nis a kind of refreshment which he is very capable of enjoying.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                              S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     For the summer Clemens and his family found a comfortable lodge in\\r\\n     the Adirondacks--a log cabin called “The Lair”--on Saranac Lake.\\r\\n     Soon after his arrival there he received an invitation to attend the\\r\\n     celebration of Missouri’s eightieth anniversary.  He sent the\\r\\n     following letter:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Edward L. Dimmitt, in St. Louis:\\r\\n\\r\\n                              AMONG THE ADIRONDACK LAKES, July 19, 1901.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. DIMMITT,--By an error in the plans, things go wrong end first\\r\\nin this world, and much precious time is lost and matters of urgent\\r\\nimportance are fatally retarded. Invitations which a brisk young fellow\\r\\nshould get, and which would transport him with joy, are delayed and\\r\\nimpeded and obstructed until they are fifty years overdue when they\\r\\nreach him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has happened again in this case.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was a boy in Missouri I was always on the lookout for invitations\\r\\nbut they always miscarried and went wandering through the aisles of\\r\\ntime; and now they are arriving when I am old and rheumatic and can’t\\r\\ntravel and must lose my chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have lost a world of delight through this matter of delaying\\r\\ninvitations. Fifty years ago I would have gone eagerly across the world\\r\\nto help celebrate anything that might turn up. IT would have made no\\r\\ndifference to me what it was, so that I was there and allowed a chance\\r\\nto make a noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole scheme of things is turned wrong end to. Life should begin\\r\\nwith age and its privileges and accumulations, and end with youth and\\r\\nits capacity to splendidly enjoy such advantages. As things are now,\\r\\nwhen in youth a dollar would bring a hundred pleasures, you can’t have\\r\\nit. When you are old, you get it and there is nothing worth buying with\\r\\nit then.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s an epitome of life. The first half of it consists of the capacity\\r\\nto enjoy without the chance; the last half consists of the chance\\r\\nwithout the capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am admonished in many ways that time is pushing me inexorably along. I\\r\\nam approaching the threshold of age; in 1977 I shall be 142. This is no\\r\\ntime to be flitting about the earth. I must cease from the activities\\r\\nproper to youth and begin to take on the dignities and gravities and\\r\\ninertia proper to that season of honorable senility which is on its way\\r\\nand imminent as indicated above.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours is a great and memorable occasion, and as a son of Missouri I\\r\\nshould hold it a high privilege to be there and share your just pride in\\r\\nthe state’s achievements; but I must deny myself the indulgence, while\\r\\nthanking you earnestly for the prized honor you have done me in asking\\r\\nme to be present.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Very truly yours,\\r\\n                              S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     In the foregoing Mark Twain touches upon one of his favorite\\r\\n     fancies: that life should begin with old age and approach strong\\r\\n     manhood, golden youth, to end at last with pampered and beloved\\r\\n     babyhood.  Possibly he contemplated writing a story with this idea\\r\\n     as the theme, but He seems never to have done so.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The reader who has followed these letters may remember Yung Wing,\\r\\n     who had charge of the Chinese educational mission in Hartford, and\\r\\n     how Mark Twain, with Twichell, called on General Grant in behalf of\\r\\n     the mission.  Yung Wing, now returned to China, had conceived the\\r\\n     idea of making an appeal to the Government of the United States for\\r\\n     relief of his starving countrymen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        AMPERSAND, N. Y., July 28, ‘01.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--As you say, it is impracticable--in my case, certainly. For\\r\\nme to assist in an appeal to that Congress of land-thieves and liars\\r\\nwould be to bring derision upon it; and for me to assist in an appeal\\r\\nfor cash to pass through the hands of those missionaries out there,\\r\\nof any denomination, Catholic or Protestant, wouldn’t do at all. They\\r\\nwouldn’t handle money which I had soiled, and I wouldn’t trust them\\r\\nwith it, anyway. They would devote it to the relief of suffering--I\\r\\nknow that--but the sufferers selected would be converts. The\\r\\nmissionary-utterances exhibit no humane feeling toward the others, but\\r\\nin place of it a spirit of hate and hostility. And it is natural;\\r\\nthe Bible forbids their presence there, their trade is unlawful, why\\r\\nshouldn’t their characters be of necessity in harmony with--but never\\r\\nmind, let it go, it irritates me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater.... I have been reading Yung Wing’s letter again. It may be that\\r\\nhe is over-wrought by his sympathies, but it may not be so. There may\\r\\nbe other reasons why the missionaries are silent about the Shensi-2-year\\r\\nfamine and cannibalism. It may be that there are so few Protestant\\r\\nconverts there that the missionaries are able to take care of them.\\r\\nThat they are not likely to largely concern themselves about Catholic\\r\\nconverts and the others, is quite natural, I think.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat crude way of appealing to this Government for help in a cause which\\r\\nhas no money in it, and no politics, rises before me again in all its\\r\\nadmirable innocence! Doesn’t Yung Wing know us yet? However, he has\\r\\nbeen absent since ‘96 or ‘97. We have gone to hell since then. Kossuth\\r\\ncouldn’t raise 30 cents in Congress, now, if he were back with his\\r\\nmoving Magyar-Tale.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am on the front porch (lower one--main deck) of our little bijou of a\\r\\ndwelling-house. The lake-edge (Lower Saranac) is so nearly under me\\r\\nthat I can’t see the shore, but only the water, small-pored with\\r\\nrain-splashes--for there is a heavy down-pour. It is charmingly like\\r\\nsitting snuggled up on a ship’s deck with the stretching sea all\\r\\naround--but very much more satisfactory, for at sea a rain-storm is\\r\\ndepressing, while here of course the effect engendered is just a deep\\r\\nsense of comfort and contentment. The heavy forest shuts us solidly\\r\\nin on three sides there are no neighbors. There are beautiful little\\r\\ntan-colored impudent squirrels about. They take tea, 5 p. m., (not\\r\\ninvited) at the table in the woods where Jean does my typewriting, and\\r\\none of them has been brave enough to sit upon Jean’s knee with his tail\\r\\ncurved over his back and munch his food. They come to dinner, 7 p.\\r\\nm., on the front porch (not invited). They all have the one\\r\\nname--Blennerhasset, from Burr’s friend--and none of them answers to it\\r\\nexcept when hungry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have been here since June 21st. For a little while we had some warm\\r\\ndays--according to the family’s estimate; I was hardly discommoded\\r\\nmyself. Otherwise the weather has been of the sort you are familiar with\\r\\nin these regions: cool days and cool nights. We have heard of the hot\\r\\nwave every Wednesday, per the weekly paper--we allow no dailies to\\r\\nintrude. Last week through visitors also--the only ones we have had--Dr.\\r\\nRoot and John Howells.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have the daily lake-swim; and all the tribe, servants included (but\\r\\nnot I) do a good deal of boating; sometimes with the guide, sometimes\\r\\nwithout him--Jean and Clara are competent with the oars. If we live\\r\\nanother year, I hope we shall spend its summer in this house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have taken the Appleton country seat, overlooking the Hudson, at\\r\\nRiverdale, 25 minutes from the Grand Central Station, for a year,\\r\\nbeginning Oct. 1, with option for another year. We are obliged to be\\r\\nclose to New York for a year or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 3rd. I go yachting a fortnight up north in a 20-knot boat 225 feet\\r\\nlong, with the owner, (Mr. Rogers), Tom Reid, Dr. Rice, Col. A. G. Paine\\r\\nand one or two others. Judge Howland would go, but can’t get away\\r\\nfrom engagements; Professor Sloane would go, but is in the grip of an\\r\\nillness. Come--will you go? If you can manage it, drop a post-card to\\r\\nme c/o H.H. Rogers, 26 Broadway. I shall be in New York a couple of days\\r\\nbefore we sail--July 31 or Aug. 1, perhaps the latter,--and I think I\\r\\nshall stop at the Hotel Grosvenor, cor. 10th St and 5th ave.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all send you and the Harmonies lots and gobs of love.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                            MARK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             AMPERSAND, N. Y., Aug. 28.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--Just a word, to scoff at you, with your extravagant\\r\\nsuggestion that I read the biography of Phillips Brooks--the very\\r\\ndullest book that has been printed for a century. Joe, ten pages of\\r\\nMrs. Cheney’s masterly biography of her fathers--no, five pages of\\r\\nit--contain more meat, more sense, more literature, more brilliancy,\\r\\nthan that whole basketful of drowsy rubbish put together. Why, in that\\r\\ndead atmosphere even Brooks himself is dull--he wearied me; oh how he\\r\\nwearied me!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a noble good time in the Yacht, and caught a Chinese missionary\\r\\nand drowned him.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Love from us all to you all.\\r\\n                                                  MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The assassination of President McKinley occurred September 6, 1901.\\r\\n     Such an event would naturally stir Mark Twain to comment on human\\r\\n     nature in general.  His letter to Twichell is as individual as it is\\r\\n     sound in philosophy.  At what period of his own life, or under what\\r\\n     circumstances, he made the long journey with tragic intent there is\\r\\n     no means of knowing now.  There is no other mention of it elsewhere\\r\\n     in the records that survive him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   AMPERSAND, Tuesday, (Sept. 10, 1901)\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--It is another off day, but tomorrow I shall resume work to a\\r\\ncertainty, and bid a long farewell to letter-scribbling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news of the President looks decidedly hopeful, and we are all glad,\\r\\nand the household faces are much improved, as to cheerfulness. Oh, the\\r\\ntalk in the newspapers! Evidently the Human Race is the same old Human\\r\\nRace. And how unjust, and unreflectingly discriminating, the talkers\\r\\nare. Under the unsettling effects of powerful emotion the talkers are\\r\\nsaying wild things, crazy things--they are out of themselves, and do not\\r\\nknow it; they are temporarily insane, yet with one voice they\\r\\ndeclare the assassin sane--a man who has been entertaining fiery and\\r\\nreason--debauching maggots in his head for weeks and months. Why, no one\\r\\nis sane, straight along, year in and year out, and we all know it.\\r\\nOur insanities are of varying sorts, and express themselves in varying\\r\\nforms--fortunately harmless forms as a rule--but in whatever form\\r\\nthey occur an immense upheaval of feeling can at any time topple us\\r\\ndistinctly over the sanity-line for a little while; and then if our form\\r\\nhappens to be of the murderous kind we must look out--and so must the\\r\\nspectator.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ass with the unpronounceable name was probably more insane than\\r\\nusual this week or two back, and may get back upon his bearings by and\\r\\nby, but he was over the sanity-border when he shot the President. It is\\r\\npossible that it has taken him the whole interval since the murder of\\r\\nthe King of Italy to get insane enough to attempt the President’s life.\\r\\nWithout a doubt some thousands of men have been meditating the same act\\r\\nin the same interval, but new and strong interests have intervened and\\r\\ndiverted their over-excited minds long enough to give them a chance to\\r\\nsettle, and tranquilize, and get back upon a healthy level again. Every\\r\\nextraordinary occurrence unsettles the heads of hundreds of thousands\\r\\nof men for a few moments or hours or days. If there had been ten kings\\r\\naround when Humbert fell they would have been in great peril for a day\\r\\nor more--and from men in whose presence they would have been quite safe\\r\\nafter the excess of their excitement had had an interval in which to\\r\\ncool down. I bought a revolver once and travelled twelve hundred miles\\r\\nto kill a man. He was away. He was gone a day. With nothing else to do,\\r\\nI had to stop and think--and did. Within an hour--within half of it--I\\r\\nwas ashamed of myself--and felt unspeakably ridiculous. I do not know\\r\\nwhat to call it if I was not insane. During a whole week my head was in\\r\\na turmoil night and day fierce enough and exhausting enough to upset a\\r\\nstronger reason than mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll over the world, every day, there are some millions of men in\\r\\nthat condition temporarily. And in that time there is always a\\r\\nmoment--perhaps only a single one when they would do murder if their man\\r\\nwas at hand. If the opportunity comes a shade too late, the chances are\\r\\nthat it has come permanently too late. Opportunity seldom comes\\r\\nexactly at the supreme moment. This saves a million lives a day in the\\r\\nworld--for sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo Ruler is ever slain but the tremendous details of it are ravenously\\r\\ndevoured by a hundred thousand men whose minds dwell, unaware, near the\\r\\ntemporary-insanity frontier--and over they go, now! There is a day--two\\r\\ndays--three--during which no Ruler would be safe from perhaps the half\\r\\nof them; and there is a single moment wherein he would not be safe from\\r\\nany of them, no doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may take this present shooting-case six months to breed another\\r\\nruler-tragedy, but it will breed it. There is at least one mind\\r\\nsomewhere which will brood, and wear, and decay itself to the\\r\\nkilling-point and produce that tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery negro burned at the stake unsettles the excitable brain of\\r\\nanother one--I mean the inflaming details of his crime, and the lurid\\r\\ntheatricality of his exit do it--and the duplicate crime follows; and\\r\\nthat begets a repetition, and that one another one and so on. Every\\r\\nlynching-account unsettles the brains of another set of excitable white\\r\\nmen, and lights another pyre--115 lynchings last year, 102 inside of 8\\r\\nmonths this year; in ten years this will be habit, on these terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, the wild talk you see in the papers! And from men who are sane when\\r\\nnot upset by overwhelming excitement. A U. S. Senator-Cullom--wants this\\r\\nBuffalo criminal lynched! It would breed other lynchings--of men who are\\r\\nnot dreaming of committing murders, now, and will commit none if Cullom\\r\\nwill keep quiet and not provide the exciting cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd a District Attorney wants a law which shall punish with death\\r\\nattempts upon a President’s life--this, mind you, as a deterrent. It\\r\\nwould have no effect--or the opposite one. The lunatic’s mind-space is\\r\\nall occupied--as mine was--with the matter in hand; there is no room\\r\\nin it for reflections upon what may happen to him. That comes after the\\r\\ncrime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the noise the attempt would make in the world that would breed the\\r\\nsubsequent attempts, by unsettling the rickety minds of men who envy\\r\\nthe criminal his vast notoriety--his obscure name tongued by stupendous\\r\\nKings and Emperors--his picture printed everywhere, the trivialest\\r\\ndetails of his movements, what he eats, what he drinks; how he sleeps,\\r\\nwhat he says, cabled abroad over the whole globe at cost of fifty\\r\\nthousand dollars a day--and he only a lowly shoemaker yesterday!--like\\r\\nthe assassin of the President of France--in debt three francs to his\\r\\nlandlady, and insulted by her--and to-day she is proud to be able to say\\r\\nshe knew him “as familiarly as you know your own brother,” and glad to\\r\\nstand till she drops and pour out columns and pages of her grandeur and\\r\\nher happiness upon the eager interviewer.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing will check the lynchings and ruler-murder but absolute\\r\\nsilence--the absence of pow-pow about them. How are you going to manage\\r\\nthat? By gagging every witness and jamming him into a dungeon for life;\\r\\nby abolishing all newspapers; by exterminating all newspaper men; and by\\r\\nextinguishing God’s most elegant invention, the Human Race. It is quite\\r\\nsimple, quite easy, and I hope you will take a day off and attend to it,\\r\\nJoe. I blow a kiss to you, and am\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   Lovingly Yours,\\r\\n                                                  MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     When the Adirondack summer ended Clemens settled for the winter in\\r\\n     the beautiful Appleton home at Riverdale-on-the-Hudson.  It was a\\r\\n     place of wide-spreading grass and shade-a house of ample room.  They\\r\\n     were established in it in time for Mark Twain to take an active\\r\\n     interest in the New York elections and assist a ticket for good\\r\\n     government to defeat Tammany Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLI. LETTERS OF 1902. RIVERDALE. YORK HARBOR. ILLNESS OF MRS. CLEMENS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1902 was an eventful one for Mark Twain. In April he received\\r\\na degree of LL.D. from the University of Missouri and returned to his\\r\\nnative State to accept it. This was his last journey to the Mississippi\\r\\nRiver. During the summer Mrs. Clemens’s health broke down and illnesses\\r\\nof one sort or another visited other members of the family. Amid so much\\r\\nstress and anxiety Clemens had little time or inclination for work.\\r\\nHe wrote not many letters and mainly somber ones. Once, by way\\r\\nof diversion, he worked out the idea of a curious club--which he\\r\\nformed--its members to be young girls--girls for the most part whom he\\r\\nhad never seen. They were elected without their consent from among those\\r\\nwho wrote to him without his consent, and it is not likely that any one\\r\\nso chosen declined membership. One selection from his letters to the\\r\\nFrench member, Miss Helene Picard, of St.-Die, France, will explain the\\r\\nclub and present a side of Mask Twain somewhat different from that found\\r\\nin most of his correspondence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Miss Picard, in St.-Die, France:\\r\\n\\r\\n                              RIVERDALE-ON-THE-HUDSON, February 22, 1902.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MISS HELENE,--If you will let me call you so, considering that my\\r\\nhead is white and that I have grownup daughters. Your beautiful letter\\r\\nhas given me such deep pleasure! I will make bold to claim you for a\\r\\nfriend and lock you up with the rest of my riches; for I am a miser who\\r\\ncounts his spoil every day and hoards it secretly and adds to it when he\\r\\ncan, and is grateful to see it grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of that gold comes, like yourself, in a sealed package, and I can’t\\r\\nsee it and may never have the happiness; but I know its value without\\r\\nthat, and by what sum it increases my wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a Club, a private Club, which is all my own. I appoint the\\r\\nMembers myself, and they can’t help themselves, because I don’t allow\\r\\nthem to vote on their own appointment and I don’t allow them to resign!\\r\\nThey are all friends whom I have never seen (save one), but who have\\r\\nwritten friendly letters to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the laws of my Club there can be only one Member in each country, and\\r\\nthere can be no male Member but myself. Some day I may admit males,\\r\\nbut I don’t know--they are capricious and inharmonious, and their ways\\r\\nprovoke me a good deal. It is a matter which the Club shall decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have made four appointments in the past three or four months: You\\r\\nas Member for France, a young Highland girl as Member for Scotland, a\\r\\nMohammedan girl as Member for Bengal, and a dear and bright young\\r\\nniece of mine as Member for the United States--for I do not represent a\\r\\ncountry myself, but am merely Member at Large for the Human Race.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must not try to resign, for the laws of the Club do not allow that.\\r\\nYou must console yourself by remembering that you are in the best of\\r\\ncompany; that nobody knows of your membership except myself--that no\\r\\nMember knows another’s name, but only her country; that no taxes are\\r\\nlevied and no meetings held (but how dearly I should like to attend\\r\\none!).\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my Members is a Princess of a royal house, another is the\\r\\ndaughter of a village book-seller on the continent of Europe. For the\\r\\nonly qualification for Membership is intellect and the spirit of good\\r\\nwill; other distinctions, hereditary or acquired, do not count.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay I send you the Constitution and Laws of the Club? I shall be so\\r\\npleased if I may. It is a document which one of my daughters typewrites\\r\\nfor me when I need one for a new Member, and she would give her eyebrows\\r\\nto know what it is all about, but I strangle her curiosity by saying:\\r\\n“There are much cheaper typewriters than you are, my dear, and if\\r\\nyou try to pry into the sacred mysteries of this Club one of your\\r\\nprosperities will perish sure.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy favorite? It is “Joan of Arc.” My next is “Huckleberry Finn,” but the\\r\\nfamily’s next is “The Prince and the Pauper.” (Yes, you are right--I\\r\\nam a moralist in disguise; it gets me into heaps of trouble when I go\\r\\nthrashing around in political questions.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish you every good fortune and happiness and I thank you so much for\\r\\nyour letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                              S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Early in the year Clemens paid a visit to Twichell in Hartford, and\\r\\n     after one of their regular arguments on theology and the moral\\r\\n     accountability of the human race, arguments that had been going on\\r\\n     between them for more than thirty years--Twichell lent his visitor\\r\\n     Freedom of the Will, by Jonathan Edwards, to read on the way home.\\r\\n     The next letter was the result.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             RIVERDALE-ON-THE-HUDSON.\\r\\n                                                       Feb. ‘02.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--“After compliments.”--[Meaning “What a good time you gave\\r\\nme; what a happiness it was to be under your roof again; etc., etc.”\\r\\n See opening sentence of all translations of letters passing between Lord\\r\\nRoberts and Indian princes and rulers.]--From Bridgeport to New York;\\r\\nthence to home; and continuously until near midnight I wallowed and\\r\\nreeked with Jonathan in his insane debauch; rose immediately refreshed\\r\\nand fine at 10 this morning, but with a strange and haunting sense of\\r\\nhaving been on a three days’ tear with a drunken lunatic. It is years\\r\\nsince I have known these sensations. All through the book is the glaze\\r\\nof a resplendent intellect gone mad--a marvelous spectacle. No, not all\\r\\nthrough the book--the drunk does not come on till the last third, where\\r\\nwhat I take to be Calvinism and its God begins to show up and shine red\\r\\nand hideous in the glow from the fires of hell, their only right and\\r\\nproper adornment. By God I was ashamed to be in such company.\\r\\n\\r\\nJonathan seems to hold (as against the Arminian position) that the Man\\r\\n(or his Soul or his Will) never creates an impulse itself, but is moved\\r\\nto action by an impulse back of it. That’s sound!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, that of two or more things offered it, it infallibly chooses the\\r\\none which for the moment is most pleasing to ITSELF. Perfectly correct!\\r\\nAn immense admission for a man not otherwise sane.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to that point he could have written chapters III and IV of my\\r\\nsuppressed “Gospel.” But there we seem to separate. He seems to concede\\r\\nthe indisputable and unshakable dominion of Motive and Necessity (call\\r\\nthem what he may, these are exterior forces and not under the man’s\\r\\nauthority, guidance or even suggestion)--then he suddenly flies the\\r\\nlogic track and (to all seeming) makes the man and not these exterior\\r\\nforces responsible to God for the man’s thoughts, words and acts. It is\\r\\nfrank insanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that when he concedes the autocratic dominion of Motive and\\r\\nNecessity he grants, a third position of mine--that a man’s mind is a\\r\\nmere machine--an automatic machine--which is handled entirely from the\\r\\noutside, the man himself furnishing it absolutely nothing: not an ounce\\r\\nof its fuel, and not so much as a bare suggestion to that exterior\\r\\nengineer as to what the machine shall do, nor how it shall do it nor\\r\\nwhen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that concession, it was time for him to get alarmed and shirk--for\\r\\nhe was pointing straight for the only rational and possible next-station\\r\\non that piece of road the irresponsibility of man to God.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so he shirked. Shirked, and arrived at this handsome result:\\r\\n\\r\\nMan is commanded to do so-and-so. It has been ordained from the\\r\\nbeginning of time that some men shan’t and others can’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are to be blamed: let them be damned.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoy the Colonel very much, and shall enjoy the rest of him with an\\r\\nobscene delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Joe, the whole tribe shout love to you and yours!\\r\\n                                                       MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     We have not heard of Joe Goodman since the trying days of ‘90 and\\r\\n     ‘91, when he was seeking to promote the fortunes of the type-setting\\r\\n     machine.  Goodman, meantime, who had in turn been miner, printer,\\r\\n     publisher, and farmer; had been devoting his energies and genius to\\r\\n     something entirely new: he had been translating the prehistoric\\r\\n     Mayan inscriptions of Yucatan, and with such success that his work\\r\\n     was elaborately published by an association of British scientists.\\r\\n     In due time a copy of this publication came to Clemens, who was full\\r\\n     of admiration of the great achievement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo J. T. Goodman, in California:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        RIVERDALE-ON-THE-HUDSON,\\r\\n                                                  June 13, ‘02.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--I am lost in reverence and admiration! It is now twenty-four\\r\\nhours that I have been trying to cool down and contemplate with quiet\\r\\nblood this extraordinary spectacle of energy, industry, perseverance,\\r\\npluck, analytical genius, penetration, this irruption of thunders\\r\\nand fiery splendors from a fair and flowery mountain that nobody had\\r\\nsupposed was a sleeping volcano, but I seem to be as excited as ever.\\r\\nYesterday I read as much as half of the book, not understanding a word\\r\\nbut enchanted nevertheless--partly by the wonder of it all, the study,\\r\\nthe erudition, the incredible labor, the modesty, the dignity, the\\r\\nmajestic exclusiveness of the field and its lofty remoteness from things\\r\\nand contacts sordid and mean and earthy, and partly by the grace and\\r\\nbeauty and limpidity of the book’s unsurpassable English. Science,\\r\\nalways great and worshipful, goes often in hodden grey, but you have\\r\\nclothed her in garments meet for her high degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou think you get “poor pay” for your twenty years? No, oh no. You have\\r\\nlived in a paradise of the intellect whose lightest joys were beyond\\r\\nthe reach of the longest purse in Christendom, you have had daily and\\r\\nnightly emancipation from the world’s slaveries and gross interests, you\\r\\nhave received a bigger wage than any man in the land, you have dreamed a\\r\\nsplendid dream and had it come true, and to-day you could not afford\\r\\nto trade fortunes with anybody--not even with another scientist, for he\\r\\nmust divide his spoil with his guild, whereas essentially the world you\\r\\nhave discovered is your own and must remain so.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is all just magnificent, Joe! And no one is prouder or gladder than\\r\\n\\r\\n               Yours always\\r\\n                              MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     At York Harbor, Maine, where they had taken a cottage for the\\r\\n     summer--a pretty place, with Howells not far distant, at Kittery\\r\\n     Point--Mrs. Clemens’s health gave way.  This was at a period when\\r\\n     telegraphic communication was far from reliable.  The old-time\\r\\n     Western Union had fallen from grace; its “system” no longer\\r\\n     justified the best significance of that word.  The new day of\\r\\n     reorganization was coming, and it was time for it.  Mark Twain’s\\r\\n     letter concerning the service at York Harbor would hardly be\\r\\n     warranted today, but those who remember conditions of that earlier\\r\\n     time will agree that it was justified then, and will appreciate its\\r\\n     satire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the President of The Western Union, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             “THE PINES”\\r\\n                                         YORK HARBOR, MAINE.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR SIR,--I desire to make a complaint, and I bring it to you, the head\\r\\nof the company, because by experience I know better than to carry it to\\r\\na subordinate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been here a month and a half, and by testimony of friends,\\r\\nreinforced by personal experience I now feel qualified to claim as an\\r\\nestablished fact that the telegraphic service here is the worst in the\\r\\nworld except that Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese services are actually slower than was the New York and Hartford\\r\\nservice in the days when I last complained to you--which was fifteen\\r\\nor eighteen years ago, when telegraphic time and train time between the\\r\\nmentioned points was exactly the same, to-wit, three hours and a half.\\r\\nSix days ago--it was that raw day which provoked so much comment--my\\r\\ndaughter was on her way up from New York, and at noon she telegraphed\\r\\nme from New Haven asking that I meet her with a cloak at Portsmouth. Her\\r\\ntelegram reached me four hours and a quarter later--just 15 minutes too\\r\\nlate for me to catch my train and meet her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI judge that the telegram traveled about 200 miles. It is the best\\r\\ntelegraphic work I have seen since I have been here, and I am mentioning\\r\\nit in this place not as a complaint but as a compliment. I think a\\r\\ncompliment ought always to precede a complaint, where one is possible,\\r\\nbecause it softens resentment and insures for the complaint a courteous\\r\\nand gentle reception.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there is a detail or two connected with this matter which ought\\r\\nperhaps to be mentioned. And now, having smoothed the way with the\\r\\ncompliment, I will venture them. The head corpse in the York Harbor\\r\\noffice sent me that telegram altho (1) he knew it would reach me too\\r\\nlate to be of any value; (2) also, that he was going to send it to me\\r\\nby his boy; (3) that the boy would not take the trolley and come the 2\\r\\nmiles in 12 minutes, but would walk; (4) that he would be two hours\\r\\nand a quarter on the road; (5) and that he would collect 25 cents for\\r\\ntransportation, for a telegram which the he knew to be worthless before\\r\\nhe started it. From these data I infer that the Western Union owes me\\r\\n75 cents; that is to say, the amount paid for combined wire and land\\r\\ntransportation--a recoup provided for in the printed paragraph which\\r\\nheads the telegraph-blank.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy these humane and Christian stages we now arrive at the complaint\\r\\nproper. We have had a grave case of illness in the family, and a\\r\\nrelative was coming some six hundred miles to help in the sick-room\\r\\nduring the convalescing period. It was an anxious time, of course, and I\\r\\nwrote and asked to be notified as to the hour of the expected arrival\\r\\nof this relative in Boston or in York Harbor. Being afraid of the\\r\\ntelegraph--which I think ought not to be used in times of hurry and\\r\\nemergency--I asked that the desired message be brought to me by some\\r\\nswift method of transportation. By the milkman, if he was coming this\\r\\nway. But there are always people who think they know more than you do,\\r\\nespecially young people; so of course the young fellow in charge of\\r\\nthis lady used the telegraph. And at Boston, of all places! Except York\\r\\nHarbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result was as usual; let me employ a statelier and exacter term, and\\r\\nsay, historical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dispatch was handed to the h. c. of the Boston office at 9 this\\r\\nmorning. It said, “Shall bring A. S. to you eleven forty-five this\\r\\nmorning.” The distance traveled by the dispatch is forty or fifty miles,\\r\\nI suppose, as the train-time is five minutes short of two hours, and the\\r\\ntrains are so slow that they can’t give a W. U. telegram two hours and\\r\\ntwenty minutes start and overtake it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I have said, the dispatch was handed in at Boston at 9. The expected\\r\\nvisitors left Boston at 9.40, and reached my house at 12 noon, beating\\r\\nthe telegram 2 solid hours, and 5 minutes over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy brought the telegram. It was bald-headed with age, but still\\r\\nlegible. The boy was prostrate with travel and exposure, but still\\r\\nalive, and I went out to condole with him and get his last wishes and\\r\\nsend for the ambulance. He was waiting to collect transportation\\r\\nbefore turning his passing spirit to less serious affairs. I found him\\r\\nstrangely intelligent, considering his condition and where he is getting\\r\\nhis training. I asked him at what hour the telegram was handed to the h.\\r\\nc. in Boston. He answered brightly, that he didn’t know.\\r\\n\\r\\nI examined the blank, and sure enough the wary Boston h. c. had\\r\\nthoughtfully concealed that statistic. I asked him at what hour it had\\r\\nstarted from Boston. He answered up as brightly as ever, and said he\\r\\ndidn’t know.\\r\\n\\r\\nI examined the blank, and sure enough the Boston h. c. had left that\\r\\nstatistic out in the cold, too. In fact it turned out to be an official\\r\\nconcealment--no blank was provided for its exposure. And none required\\r\\nby the law, I suppose. “It is a good one-sided idea,” I remarked;\\r\\n“They can take your money and ship your telegram next year if they want\\r\\nto--you’ve no redress. The law ought to extend the privilege to all of\\r\\nus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy looked upon me coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked him when the telegram reached York Harbor. He pointed to some\\r\\nfigures following the signature at the bottom of the blank--“12.14.” I\\r\\nsaid it was now 1.45 and asked--\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you mean that it reached your morgue an hour and a half ago?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was at that time half an hour too late to be of any use to me, if I\\r\\nwanted to go and meet my people--which was the case--for by the wording\\r\\nof the message you can see that they were to arrive at the station at\\r\\n11.45. Why did, your h. c. send me this useless message? Can’t he read?\\r\\nIs he dead?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the rules.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, that does not account for it. Would he have sent it if it had been\\r\\nthree years old, I in the meantime deceased, and he aware of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy didn’t know.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because, you know, a rule which required him to forward to the cemetery\\r\\nto-day a dispatch due three years ago, would be as good a rule as one\\r\\nwhich should require him to forward a telegram to me to-day which he\\r\\nknew had lost all its value an hour or two before he started it.\\r\\nThe construction of such a rule would discredit an idiot; in fact an\\r\\nidiot--I mean a common ordinary Christian idiot, you understand--would\\r\\nbe ashamed of it, and for the sake of his reputation wouldn’t make it.\\r\\nWhat do you think?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe replied with much natural brilliancy that he wasn’t paid for\\r\\nthinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gave me a better opinion of the commercial intelligence pervading\\r\\nhis morgue than I had had before; it also softened my feelings toward\\r\\nhim, and also my tone, which had hitherto been tinged with bitterness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let bygones be bygones,” I said, gently, “we are all erring creatures,\\r\\nand mainly idiots, but God made us so and it is dangerous to criticise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Sincerely\\r\\n                                   S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     One day there arrived from Europe a caller with a letter of\\r\\n     introduction from Elizabeth, Queen of Rumania, better known as\\r\\n     Carmen Sylva.  The visitor was Madam Hartwig, formerly an American\\r\\n     girl, returning now, because of reduced fortunes, to find profitable\\r\\n     employment in her own land.  Her husband, a man of high principle,\\r\\n     had declined to take part in an “affair of honor,” as recognized by\\r\\n     the Continental code; hence his ruin.  Elizabeth of Rumania was one\\r\\n     of the most loved and respected of European queens and an author of\\r\\n     distinction.  Mark Twain had known her in Vienna.  Her letter to him\\r\\n     and his own letter to the public (perhaps a second one, for its date\\r\\n     is two years later) follow herewith.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                     From Carmen Sylva to Mark Twain:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  BUCAREST, May 9, 1902.\\r\\n\\r\\nHONORED MASTER,--If I venture to address you on behalf of a poor lady,\\r\\nwho is stranded in Bucarest I hope not to be too disagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hartwig left America at the age of fourteen in order to learn to\\r\\nsing which she has done thoroughly. Her husband had quite a brilliant\\r\\nsituation here till he refused to partake ‘dans une afaire onereuse’,\\r\\nso it seems. They haven’t a penny and each of them must try to find a\\r\\nliving. She is very nice and pleasant and her school is so good that she\\r\\nmost certainly can give excellent singing lessons.\\r\\n\\r\\nI beg your pardon for being a bore to one I so deeply love and admire,\\r\\nto whom I owe days and days of forgetfulness of self and troubles and\\r\\nthe intensest of all joys: Hero-worship! People don’t always realize\\r\\nwhat a happiness that is! God bless you for every beautiful thought you\\r\\npoured into my tired heart and for every smile on a weary way!\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  CARMEN SYLVA.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                      From Mark Twain to the Public:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       Nov.  16, ‘04.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,--I desire to recommend Madame Hartwig to\\r\\nmy friends and the public as a teacher of singing and as a\\r\\nconcert-vocalist. She has lived for fifteen years at the court of\\r\\nRoumania, and she brought with her to America an autograph letter in\\r\\nwhich her Majesty the Queen of Roumania cordially certified her to me\\r\\nas being an accomplished and gifted singer and teacher of singing, and\\r\\nexpressed a warm hope that her professional venture among us would meet\\r\\nwith success; through absence in Europe I have had no opportunity\\r\\nto test the validity of the Queen’s judgment in the matter, but that\\r\\njudgment is the utterance of an entirely competent authority--the best\\r\\nthat occupies a throne, and as good as any that sits elsewhere, as the\\r\\nmusical world well knows--and therefore back it without hesitation, and\\r\\nendorse it with confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will explain that the reason her Majesty tried to do her friend a\\r\\nfriendly office through me instead of through someone else was, not that\\r\\nI was particularly the right or best person for the office, but because\\r\\nI was not a stranger. It is true that I am a stranger to some of the\\r\\nmonarchs--mainly through their neglect of their opportunities--but\\r\\nsuch is not the case in the present instance. The latter fact is a high\\r\\ncompliment to me, and perhaps I ought to conceal it. Some people would.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        MARK TWAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Mrs. Clemens’s improvement was scarcely perceptible.  It was not\\r\\n     until October that they were able to remove her to Riverdale, and\\r\\n     then only in a specially arranged invalid-car.  At the end of the\\r\\n     long journey she was carried to her room and did not leave it again\\r\\n     for many months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        RIVERDALE, N. Y., Oct. 31, ‘02.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--It is ten days since Susy [Twichell] wrote that you were laid\\r\\nup with a sprained shoulder, since which time we have had no news about\\r\\nit. I hope that no news is good news, according to the proverb; still,\\r\\nauthoritative confirmation of it will be gladly received in this family,\\r\\nif some of you will furnish it. Moreover, I should like to know how and\\r\\nwhere it happened. In the pulpit, as like as not, otherwise you would\\r\\nnot be taking so much pains to conceal it. This is not a malicious\\r\\nsuggestion, and not a personally-invented one: you told me yourself,\\r\\nonce, that you threw artificial power and impressiveness into places in\\r\\nyour sermons where needed, by “banging the bible”--(your own words.) You\\r\\nhave reached a time of life when it is not wise to take these risks.\\r\\nYou would better jump around. We all have to change our methods as the\\r\\ninfirmities of age creep upon us. Jumping around will be impressive now,\\r\\nwhereas before you were gray it would have excited remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Livy drags along drearily. It must be hard times for that turbulent\\r\\nspirit. It will be a long time before she is on her feet again. It is\\r\\na most pathetic case. I wish I could transfer it to myself. Between\\r\\nripping and raging and smoking and reading, I could get a good deal of a\\r\\nholiday out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nClara runs the house smoothly and capably.

Occasionally he was allowed to send her a few\\r\\n     lines, reporting his occupations, and these she was\\r\\n     sometimes permitted to answer.  Only one of his notes has\\r\\n     been preserved, written after a day, now rare, of literary\\r\\n     effort.  Its signature, the letter Y, stands for “Youth,”\\r\\n      always her name for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mrs. Clemens:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR HEART,--I’ve done another full day’s work, and finished before 4. I\\r\\nhave been reading and dozing since and would have had a real sleep a\\r\\nfew minutes ago but for an incursion to bring me a couple of unimportant\\r\\nletters. I’ve stuck to the bed all day and am getting back my lost\\r\\nground. Next time I will be strictly careful and make my visit very\\r\\nshort--just a kiss and a rush. Thank you for your dear, dear note; you\\r\\nwho are my own and only sweetheart.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        Sleep well!\\r\\n                                                       Y.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLII. LETTERS OF 1903. TO VARIOUS PERSONS. HARD DAYS AT RIVERDALE. LAST\\r\\nSUMMER AT ELMIRA. THE RETURN TO ITALY.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The reader may perhaps recall that H. H. Rogers, some five\\r\\n     or six years earlier, had taken charge of the fortunes of\\r\\n     Helen Keller, making it possible for her to complete her\\r\\n     education.  Helen had now written her first book--a\\r\\n     wonderful book--‘The Story of My Life’, and it had been\\r\\n     successfully published.  For a later generation it may be\\r\\n     proper to explain that the Miss Sullivan, later Mrs. Macy,\\r\\n     mentioned in the letter which follows, was the noble woman\\r\\n     who had devoted her life to the enlightenment of this blind,\\r\\n     dumb girl--had made it possible for her to speak and\\r\\n     understand, and, indeed, to see with the eyes of luminous\\r\\n     imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The case of plagiarism mentioned in this letter is not now\\r\\n     remembered, and does not matter, but it furnished a text for\\r\\n     Mark Twain, whose remarks on the subject in general are\\r\\n     eminently worth while.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Helen Keller, in Wrentham, Mass.:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             RIVERDALE-ON-THE-HUDSON,\\r\\n                                             ST.  PATRICK’S DAY, ‘03.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR HELEN,--I must steal half a moment from my work to say how glad I\\r\\nam to have your book, and how highly I value it, both for its own sake\\r\\nand as a remembrances of an affectionate friendship which has subsisted\\r\\nbetween us for nine years without a break, and without a single act of\\r\\nviolence that I can call to mind. I suppose there is nothing like it in\\r\\nheaven; and not likely to be, until we get there and show off. I often\\r\\nthink of it with longing, and how they’ll say, “There they come--sit\\r\\ndown in front!” I am practicing with a tin halo. You do the same. I was\\r\\nat Henry Rogers’s last night, and of course we talked of you. He is not\\r\\nat all well; you will not like to hear that; but like you and me, he is\\r\\njust as lovely as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am charmed with your book-enchanted. You are a wonderful creature,\\r\\nthe most wonderful in the world--you and your other half together--Miss\\r\\nSullivan, I mean, for it took the pair of you to make a complete and\\r\\nperfect whole. How she stands out in her letters! her brilliancy,\\r\\npenetration, originality, wisdom, character, and the fine literary\\r\\ncompetencies of her pen--they are all there.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, dear me, how unspeakably funny and owlishly idiotic and grotesque\\r\\nwas that “plagiarism” farce! As if there was much of anything in any\\r\\nhuman utterance, oral or written, except plagiarism! The kernel, the\\r\\nsoul--let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual\\r\\nand valuable material of all human utterances--is plagiarism. For\\r\\nsubstantially all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously\\r\\ndrawn from a million outside sources, and daily used by the garnerer\\r\\nwith a pride and satisfaction born of the superstition that he\\r\\noriginated them; whereas there is not a rag of originality about them\\r\\nanywhere except the little discoloration they get from his mental\\r\\nand moral calibre and his temperament, and which is revealed in\\r\\ncharacteristics of phrasing. When a great orator makes a great speech\\r\\nyou are listening to ten centuries and ten thousand men--but we call it\\r\\nhis speech, and really some exceedingly small portion of it is his.\\r\\nBut not enough to signify. It is merely a Waterloo. It is Wellington’s\\r\\nbattle, in some degree, and we call it his; but there are others that\\r\\ncontributed. It takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph, or a steam\\r\\nengine, or a phonograph, or a photograph, or a telephone or any other\\r\\nimportant thing--and the last man gets the credit and we forget the\\r\\nothers. He added his little mite--that is all he did. These object\\r\\nlessons should teach us that ninety-nine parts of all things that\\r\\nproceed from the intellect are plagiarisms, pure and simple; and the\\r\\nlesson ought to make us modest. But nothing can do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen why don’t we unwittingly reproduce the phrasing of a story, as well\\r\\nas the story itself? It can hardly happen--to the extent of fifty words\\r\\nexcept in the case of a child: its memory-tablet is not lumbered with\\r\\nimpressions, and the actual language can have graving-room there, and\\r\\npreserve the language a year or two, but a grown person’s memory-tablet\\r\\nis a palimpsest, with hardly a bare space upon which to engrave a\\r\\nphrase. It must be a very rare thing that a whole page gets so sharply\\r\\nprinted upon a man’s mind, by a single reading, that it will stay long\\r\\nenough to turn up some time or other and be mistaken by him for his own.\\r\\nNo doubt we are constantly littering our literature with disconnected\\r\\nsentences borrowed from books at some unremembered time and now imagined\\r\\nto be our own, but that is about the most we can do. In 1866 I read Dr.\\r\\nHolmes’s poems, in the Sandwich Islands. A year and a half later I stole\\r\\nhis dictation, without knowing it, and used it to dedicate my “Innocents\\r\\nAbroad” with. Then years afterwards I was talking with Dr. Holmes about\\r\\nit. He was not an ignorant ass--no, not he: he was not a collection of\\r\\ndecayed human turnips, like your “Plagiarism Court;” and so when I said,\\r\\n“I know now where I stole it, but whom did you steal it from,” he said,\\r\\n“I don’t remember; I only know I stole it from somebody, because I have\\r\\nnever originated anything altogether myself, nor met anybody who had.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTo think of those solemn donkeys breaking a little child’s heart\\r\\nwith their ignorant rubbish about plagiarism! I couldn’t sleep for\\r\\nblaspheming about it last night. Why, their whole lives, their whole\\r\\nhistories, all their learning, all their thoughts, all their opinions\\r\\nwere one solid ruck of plagiarism, and they didn’t know it and\\r\\nnever suspected it. A gang of dull and hoary pirates piously setting\\r\\nthemselves the task of disciplining and purifying a kitten that they\\r\\nthink they’ve caught filching a chop! Oh, dam--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you finish it, dear, I am running short of vocabulary today. Ever\\r\\nlovingly your friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Edited and modified by Clara Clemens, deputy to her mother, who for\\r\\nmore than 7 months has been ill in bed and unable to exercise her\\r\\nofficial function.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The burden of the Clemens household had fallen almost entirely upon\\r\\n     Clara Clemens.  In addition to supervising its customary affairs,\\r\\n     she also shouldered the responsibility of an unusual combination of\\r\\n     misfortunes, for besides the critical condition of her mother, her\\r\\n     sister, Jean Clemens, was down with pneumonia, no word of which must\\r\\n     come to Mrs. Clemens.  Certainly it was a difficult position.  In\\r\\n     some account of it, which he set down later, Clemens wrote: “It was\\r\\n     fortunate for us all that Clara’s reputation for truthfulness was so\\r\\n     well established in her mother’s mind.  It was our daily protection\\r\\n     from disaster.  The mother never doubted Clara’s word.  Clara could\\r\\n     tell her large improbabilities without exciting any suspicion,\\r\\n     whereas if I tried to market even a small and simple one the case\\r\\n     would have been different.  I was never able to get a reputation\\r\\n     like Clara’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     The accumulation of physical ailments in the Clemens home had\\r\\n     somewhat modified Mark Twain’s notion of medical practice.  He was\\r\\n     no longer radical; he had become eclectic.  It is a good deal of a\\r\\n     concession that he makes to Twichell, after those earlier letters\\r\\n     from Sweden, in which osteopathy had been heralded as the anodyne\\r\\n     for all human ills.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--Livy does really make a little progress these past 3 or\\r\\n4 days, progress which is visible to even the untrained eye. The\\r\\nphysicians are doing good work with her, but my notion is, that no art\\r\\nof healing is the best for all ills. I should distribute the ailments\\r\\naround: surgery cases to the surgeons; lupus to the actinic-ray\\r\\nspecialist; nervous prostration to the Christian Scientist; most ills to\\r\\nthe allopath and the homeopath; (in my own particular case) rheumatism,\\r\\ngout and bronchial attacks to the osteopathist.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Rogers was to sail southward this morning--and here is this weather!\\r\\nI am sorry. I think it’s a question if he gets away tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Ys Ever\\r\\n                                        MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     It was through J. Y. M. MacAlister, to whom the next letter is\\r\\n     written, that Mark Twain had become associated with the Plasmon\\r\\n     Company, which explains the reference to “shares.”  He had seen much\\r\\n     of MacAlister during the winter at Tedworth Square, and had grown\\r\\n     fond of him.  It is a characteristic letter, and one of interesting\\r\\n     fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo J. Y. M. MacAlister, in London:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  RIVERDALE, NEW YORK.\\r\\n                                                       April, 7, ‘03.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MACALISTER,--Yours arrived last night, and God knows I was glad to\\r\\nget it, for I was afraid I had blundered into an offence in some way and\\r\\nforfeited your friendship--a kind of blunder I have made so many times\\r\\nin my life that I am always standing in a waiting and morbid dread of\\r\\nits occurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree days ago I was in condition--during one horribly long night--to\\r\\nsympathetically roast with you in your “hell of troubles.” During that\\r\\nnight I was back again where I was in the black days when I was buried\\r\\nunder a mountain of debt. I called the daughters to me in private\\r\\ncouncil and paralysed them with the announcement, “Our outgo has\\r\\nincreased in the past 8 months until our expenses are now 125 per cent.\\r\\ngreater than our income.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a mistake. When I came down in the morning a gray and aged wreck,\\r\\nand went over the figures again, I found that in some unaccountable way\\r\\n(unaccountable to a business man but not to me) I had multiplied the\\r\\ntotals by 2. By God I dropped 75 years on the floor where I stood.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you know it affected me as one is affected when he wakes out of a\\r\\nhideous dream and finds that it was only a dream. It was a great comfort\\r\\nand satisfaction to me to call the daughters to a private meeting of the\\r\\nBoard again and say, “You need not worry any more; our outgo is only a\\r\\nthird more than our income; in a few months your mother will be out of\\r\\nher bed and on her feet again--then we shall drop back to normal and be\\r\\nall right.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly there is a blistering and awful reality about a well-arranged\\r\\nunreality. It is quite within the possibilities that two or three nights\\r\\nlike that night of mine could drive a man to suicide. He would refuse\\r\\nto examine the figures; they would revolt him so, and he could go to his\\r\\ndeath unaware that there was nothing serious about them. I cannot get\\r\\nthat night out of my head, it was so vivid, so real, so ghastly. In any\\r\\nother year of these 33 the relief would have been simple: go where you\\r\\ncan cut your cloth to fit your income. You can’t do that when your wife\\r\\ncan’t be moved, even from one room to the next.\\r\\n\\r\\nClam spells the trained nurse afternoons; I am allowed to see Mrs.\\r\\nClemens 20 minutes twice a day and write her two letters a day provided\\r\\nI put no news in them. No other person ever sees her except the\\r\\nphysician and now and then a nerve-specialist from New York. She saw\\r\\nthere was something the matter that morning, but she got no facts out of\\r\\nme. But that is nothing--she hasn’t had anything but lies for 8 months.\\r\\nA fact would give her a relapse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor and a specialist met in conspiracy five days ago, and\\r\\nin their belief she will by and by come out of this as good as new,\\r\\nsubstantially. They ordered her to Italy for next winter--which seems\\r\\nto indicate that by autumn she will be able to undertake the voyage. So\\r\\nClara is writing a Florence friend to take a look round among the villas\\r\\nfor us in the regions near that city. It seems early to do this, but\\r\\nJoan Bergheim thought it would be wise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe and his wife lunched with us here yesterday. They have been abroad in\\r\\nHavana 4 months, and they sailed for England this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am enclosing an order for half of my (your) Founders shares. You are\\r\\nnot to refuse them this time, though you have done it twice before.\\r\\nThey are yours, not mine, and for your family’s sake if not your own you\\r\\ncannot in these cloudy days renounce this property which is so clearly\\r\\nyours and theirs. You have been generous long enough; be just, now to\\r\\nyourself. Mr. Rogers is off yachting for 5 or 6 weeks--I’ll get them\\r\\nwhen he returns. The head of the house joins me in warmest greetings and\\r\\nremembrances to you and Mrs. MacAlister.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Ever yours,\\r\\n                                        Mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 8. Great Scott! I never mailed this letter! I addressed it, put\\r\\n“Registered” on it--then left it lying unsealed on the arm of my chair,\\r\\nand rushed up to my bed quaking with a chill. I’ve never been out of the\\r\\nbed since--oh, bronchitis, rheumatism, two sets of teeth aching, land,\\r\\nI’ve had a dandy time for 4 weeks. And to-day--great guns, one of the\\r\\nvery worst!...\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m devilish sorry, and I do apologise--for although I am not as slow\\r\\nas you are about answering letters, as a rule, I see where I’m standing\\r\\nthis time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo weeks ago Jean was taken down again--this time with measles, and I\\r\\nhaven’t been able to go to her and she hasn’t been able to come to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mrs. Clemens is making nice progress, and can stand alone a moment\\r\\nor two at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I’ll post this.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   MARK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The two letters that follow, though written only a few days apart,\\r\\n     were separated in their arrival by a period of seven years.  The\\r\\n     second letter was, in some way, mislaid and not mailed; and it was\\r\\n     not until after the writer of it was dead that it was found and\\r\\n     forwarded.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Mark Twain could never get up much enthusiasm for the writings of\\r\\n     Scott.  His praise of Quentin Durward is about the only approval he\\r\\n     ever accorded to the works of the great romanticist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Brander Matthews, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             NEW YORK CITY, May 4, ‘03.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR BRANDER,--I haven’t been out of my bed for four weeks, but--well,\\r\\nI have been reading, a good deal, and it occurs to me to ask you to sit\\r\\ndown, some time or other when you have 8 or 9 months to spare, and jot\\r\\nme down a certain few literary particulars for my help and elevation.\\r\\nYour time need not be thrown away, for at your further leisure you can\\r\\nmake Colombian lectures out of the results and do your students a good\\r\\nturn.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Are there in Sir Walter’s novels passages done in good\\r\\nEnglish--English which is neither slovenly or involved?\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Are there passages whose English is not poor and thin and\\r\\ncommonplace, but is of a quality above that?\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Are there passages which burn with real fire--not punk, fox-fire,\\r\\nmake believe?\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Has he heroes and heroines who are not cads and cadesses?\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Has he personages whose acts and talk correspond with their\\r\\ncharacters as described by him?\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Has he heroes and heroines whom the reader admires, admires, and\\r\\nknows why?\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Has he funny characters that are funny, and humorous passages that\\r\\nare humorous?\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Does he ever chain the reader’s interest, and make him reluctant to\\r\\nlay the book down?\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Are there pages where he ceases from posing, ceases from admiring\\r\\nthe placid flood and flow of his own dilutions, ceases from being\\r\\nartificial, and is for a time, long or short, recognizably sincere and\\r\\nin earnest?\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Did he know how to write English, and didn’t do it because he didn’t\\r\\nwant to?\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Did he use the right word only when he couldn’t think of another\\r\\none, or did he run so much to wrong because he didn’t know the right one\\r\\nwhen he saw it?\\r\\n\\r\\n13. Can you read him? and keep your respect for him? Of course a person\\r\\ncould in his day--an era of sentimentality and sloppy romantics--but\\r\\nland! can a body do it today?\\r\\n\\r\\nBrander, I lie here dying, slowly dying, under the blight of Sir Walter.\\r\\nI have read the first volume of Rob Roy, and as far as chapter XIX\\r\\nof Guy Mannering, and I can no longer hold my head up nor take my\\r\\nnourishment. Lord, it’s all so juvenile! so artificial, so shoddy;\\r\\nand such wax figures and skeletons and spectres. Interest? Why, it\\r\\nis impossible to feel an interest in these bloodless shams, these\\r\\nmilk-and-water humbugs. And oh, the poverty of the invention! Not\\r\\npoverty in inventing situations, but poverty in furnishing reasons\\r\\nfor them. Sir Walter usually gives himself away when he arranges for a\\r\\nsituation--elaborates, and elaborates, and elaborates, till if you live\\r\\nto get to it you don’t believe in it when it happens.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can’t find the rest of Rob Roy, I can’t stand any more Mannering--I\\r\\ndo not know just what to do, but I will reflect, and not quit this great\\r\\nstudy rashly. He was great, in his day, and to his proper audience; and\\r\\nso was God in Jewish times, for that matter, but why should either\\r\\nof them rank high now? And do they?--honest, now, do they? Dam’d if I\\r\\nbelieve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy, I wish I could see you and Leigh Hunt!\\r\\n\\r\\n                                      Sincerely Yours\\r\\n                                             S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Brander Matthews, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                              RIVERDALE, May 8,’03 (Mailed June, 1910).\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR BRANDER,--I’m still in bed, but the days have lost their dulness\\r\\nsince I broke into Sir Walter and lost my temper. I finished Guy\\r\\nMannering--that curious, curious book, with its mob of squalid shadows\\r\\njabbering around a single flesh-and-blood being--Dinmont; a book crazily\\r\\nput together out of the very refuse of the romance-artist’s stage\\r\\nproperties--finished it and took up Quentin Durward, and finished that.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was like leaving the dead to mingle with the living: it was like\\r\\nwithdrawing from the infant class in the College of journalism to sit\\r\\nunder the lectures in English literature in Columbia University.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder who wrote Quentin Durward?\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   Yrs ever\\r\\n                                             MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     In 1903, preparations were going on for a great world’s fair, to be\\r\\n     held in St. Louis, and among other features proposed was a World’s\\r\\n     Literary Convention, with a week to be set apart in honor of Mark\\r\\n     Twain, and a special Mark Twain Day in it, on which the National\\r\\n     Association would hold grand services in honor of the distinguished\\r\\n     Missourian.  A letter asking his consent to the plan brought the\\r\\n     following reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo T. F. Gatts, of Missouri:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  NEW YORK, May 30, 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. GATTS,--It is indeed a high compliment which you offer me in\\r\\nnaming an association after me and in proposing the setting apart of a\\r\\nMark Twain day at the great St. Louis fair, but such compliments are\\r\\nnot proper for the living; they are proper and safe for the dead only. I\\r\\nvalue the impulse which moves you to tender me these honors. I value it\\r\\nas highly as any one can, and am grateful for it, but I should stand in\\r\\na sort of terror of the honors themselves. So long as we remain alive we\\r\\nare not safe from doing things which, however righteously and honorably\\r\\nintended, can wreck our repute and extinguish our friendships.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope that no society will be named for me while I am still alive, for\\r\\nI might at some time or other do something which would cause its members\\r\\nto regret having done me that honor. After I shall have joined the dead\\r\\nI shall follow the customs of those people and be guilty of no conduct\\r\\nthat can wound any friend; but until that time shall come I shall be a\\r\\ndoubtful quantity like the rest of our race.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Very truly yours,\\r\\n                                        S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The National Mark Twain Association did not surrender easily.  Mr.\\r\\n     Gatts wrote a second letter full of urgent appeal.  If Mark Twain\\r\\n     was tempted, we get no hint of it in his answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo T. F. Gatts, of Missouri:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             NEW YORK, June 8, 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. GATTS,--While I am deeply touched by the desire of my friends\\r\\nof Hannibal to confer these great honors upon me, I must still forbear\\r\\nto accept them. Spontaneous and unpremeditated honors, like those which\\r\\ncame to me at Hannibal, Columbia, St. Louis and at the village stations\\r\\nall down the line, are beyond all price and are a treasure for life\\r\\nin the memory, for they are a free gift out of the heart and they\\r\\ncome without solicitations; but I am a Missourian and so I shrink from\\r\\ndistinctions which have to be arranged beforehand and with my privity,\\r\\nfor I then became a party to my own exalting. I am humanly fond\\r\\nof honors that happen but chary of those that come by canvass and\\r\\nintention. With sincere thanks to you and your associates for this high\\r\\ncompliment which you have been minded to offer me, I am,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   Very truly yours,\\r\\n                                             S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     We have seen in the letter to MacAlister that Mark Twain’s wife had\\r\\n     been ordered to Italy and plans were in progress for an\\r\\n     establishment there.  By the end of June Mrs. Clemens was able to\\r\\n     leave Riverdale, and she made the journey to Quarry Farm, Elmira,\\r\\n     where they would remain until October, the month planned for their\\r\\n     sailing.  The house in Hartford had been sold; and a house which,\\r\\n     prior to Mrs. Clemens’s breakdown they had bought near Tarrytown\\r\\n     (expecting to settle permanently on the Hudson) had been let.  They\\r\\n     were going to Europe for another indefinite period.\\r\\n\\r\\n     At Quarry Farm Mrs. Clemens continued to improve, and Clemens, once\\r\\n     more able to work, occupied the study which Mrs. Crane had built for\\r\\n     him thirty years before, and where Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn and the\\r\\n     Wandering Prince had been called into being.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford, Conn.:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             QUARRY FARM, ELMIRA, N. Y.,\\r\\n                                                       July 21, ‘03.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--That love-letter delighted Livy beyond any like utterance\\r\\nreceived by her these thirty years and more. I was going to answer\\r\\nit for her right away, and said so; but she reserved the privilege to\\r\\nherself. I judge she is accumulating Hot Stuff--as George Ade would\\r\\nsay....\\r\\n\\r\\nLivy is coming along: eats well, sleeps some, is mostly very gay, not\\r\\nvery often depressed; spends all day on the porch, sleeps there a part\\r\\nof the night, makes excursions in carriage and in wheel-chair; and,\\r\\nin the matter of superintending everything and everybody, has resumed\\r\\nbusiness at the old stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you ever go house-hunting 3,000 miles away? It costs three months of\\r\\nwriting and telegraphing to pull off a success. We finished 3 or 4 days\\r\\nago, and took the Villa Papiniano (dam the name, I have to look at it\\r\\na minutes after writing it, and then am always in doubt) for a year\\r\\nby cable. Three miles outside of Florence, under Fiesole--a darling\\r\\nlocation, and apparently a choice house, near Fiske.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s 7 in our gang. All women but me. It means trunks and things.\\r\\nBut thanks be! To-day (this is private) comes a most handsome voluntary\\r\\ndocument with seals and escutcheons on it from the Italian Ambassador\\r\\n(who is a stranger to me) commanding the Customs people to keep their\\r\\nhands off the Clemens’s things. Now wasn’t it lovely of him? And wasn’t\\r\\nit lovely of me to let Livy take a pencil and edit my answer and knock a\\r\\ngood third of it out?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that’s a nice ship--the Irene! new--swift--13,000 tons--rooms up in\\r\\nthe sky, open to sun and air--and all that. I was desperately troubled\\r\\nfor Livy--about the down-cellar cells in the ancient “Latin.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cubs are in Riverdale, yet; they come to us the first week in\\r\\nAugust.\\r\\n\\r\\n               With lots and lots of love to you all,\\r\\n                                        MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The arrangement for the Villa Papiniano was not completed, after\\r\\n     all, and through a good friend, George Gregory Smith, a resident of\\r\\n     Florence, the Villa Quarto, an ancient home of royalty, on the hills\\r\\n     west of Florence, was engaged.  Smith wrote that it was a very\\r\\n     beautiful place with a south-eastern exposure, looking out toward\\r\\n     Valombrosa and the Chianti Hills.  It had extensive grounds and\\r\\n     stables, and the annual rental for it all was two thousand dollars a\\r\\n     year.  It seemed an ideal place, in prospect, and there was great\\r\\n     hope that Mrs. Clemens would find her health once more in the\\r\\n     Italian climate which she loved.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Perhaps at this point, when Mark Twain is once more leaving America,\\r\\n     we may offer two letters from strangers to him--letters of\\r\\n     appreciation--such as he was constantly receiving from those among\\r\\n     the thousands to whom he had given happiness.  The first is from\\r\\n     Samuel Merwin, one day to become a popular novelist, then in the\\r\\n     hour of his beginnings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mark Twain, from Samuel Merwin:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       PLAINFIELD, N. J.\\r\\n                                                       August 4, 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. CLEMENS,--For a good many years I have been struggling with the\\r\\ntemptation to write you and thank you for the work you have done; and\\r\\nto-day I seem to be yielding.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the past two years I have been reading through a group of writers\\r\\nwho seem to me to represent about the best we have--Sir Thomas Malory,\\r\\nSpenser, Shakespeare, Boswell, Carlyle, Le Sage. In thinking over one\\r\\nand then another, and then all of them together, it was plain to see\\r\\nwhy they were great men and writers: each brought to his time some new\\r\\nblood, new ideas,--turned a new current into the stream. I suppose\\r\\nthere have always been the careful, painstaking writers, the men who are\\r\\nalways taken so seriously by their fellow craftsmen. It seems to be the\\r\\nunconventional man who is so rare--I mean the honestly unconventional\\r\\nman, who has to express himself in his own big way because the\\r\\nconventional way isn’t big enough, because ne needs room and freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have a group of the more or less conventional men now--men of dignity\\r\\nand literary position. But in spite of their influence and of all the\\r\\nwork they have done, there isn’t one of them to whom one can give one’s\\r\\nself up without reservation, not one whose ideas seem based on the deep\\r\\nfoundation of all true philosophy,--except Mark Twain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope this letter is not an impertinence. I have just been turning\\r\\nabout, with my head full of Spenser and Shakespeare and “Gil Blas,”\\r\\n looking for something in our own present day literature to which I could\\r\\nsurrender myself as to those five gripping old writings. And nothing\\r\\ncould I find until I took up “Life on the Mississippi,” and “Huckleberry\\r\\nFinn,” and, just now, the “Connecticut Yankee.” It isn’t the first time\\r\\nI have read any of these three, and it’s because I know it won’t be the\\r\\nlast, because these books are the only ones written in my lifetime that\\r\\nclaim my unreserved interest and admiration and, above all, my feelings,\\r\\nthat I’ve felt I had to write this letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like to think that “Tom Sawyer” and “Huckleberry Finn” will be looked\\r\\nupon, fifty or a hundred years from now, as the picture of buoyant,\\r\\ndramatic, human American life. I feel, deep in my own heart, pretty\\r\\nsure that they will be. They won’t be looked on then as the work of a\\r\\n“humorist” any more than we think of Shakespeare as a humorist now.\\r\\nI don’t mean by this to set up a comparison between Mark Twain and\\r\\nShakespeare: I don’t feel competent to do it; and I’m not at all sure\\r\\nthat it could be done until Mark Twain’s work shall have its fair share\\r\\nof historical perspective. But Shakespeare was a humorist and so, thank\\r\\nHeaven! is Mark Twain. And Shakespeare plunged deep into the deep, sad\\r\\nthings of life; and so, in a different way (but in a way that has more\\r\\nthan once brought tears to my eyes) has Mark Twain. But after all,\\r\\nit isn’t because of any resemblance for anything that was ever before\\r\\nwritten that Mark Twain’s books strike in so deep: it’s rather because\\r\\nthey’ve brought something really new into our literature--new, yet old\\r\\nas Adam and Eve and the Apple. And this achievement, the achievement\\r\\nof putting something into literature that was not there before, is, I\\r\\nshould think, the most that any writer can ever hope to do. It is the\\r\\none mark of distinction between the “lonesome” little group of big men\\r\\nand the vast herd of medium and small ones. Anyhow, this much I am sure\\r\\nof--to the young man who hopes, however feebly, to accomplish a little\\r\\nsomething, someday, as a writer, the one inspiring example of our time\\r\\nis Mark Twain.                         Very truly yours,\\r\\n                                        SAMUEL MERWIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMark Twain once said he could live a month on a good compliment, and\\r\\nfrom his reply, we may believe this one to belong in, that class.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Samuel Merwin, in Plainfield, N. J.:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       Aug.  16, ‘03.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. MERWIN,--What you have said has given me deep pleasure--indeed\\r\\nI think no words could be said that could give me more.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Very sincerely yours,\\r\\n                                             S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The next “compliment” is from one who remains unknown, for she\\r\\n     failed to sign her name in full.  But it is a lovely letter, and\\r\\n     loses nothing by the fact that the writer of it was willing to\\r\\n     remain in obscurity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mark Twain, from Margaret M----:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  PORTLAND, OREGON\\r\\n                                                  Aug. 18, 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR, DEAR MARK TWAIN,--May a little girl write and tell you how\\r\\ndearly she loves and admires your writings? Well, I do and I want to\\r\\ntell you your ownself. Don’t think me too impertinent for indeed I don’t\\r\\nmean to be that! I have read everything of yours that I could get and\\r\\nparts that touch me I have read over and over again. They seem such\\r\\ndear friends to me, so like real live human beings talking and laughing,\\r\\nworking and suffering too! One cannot but feel that it is your own life\\r\\nand experience that you have painted. So do not wonder that you seem a\\r\\ndear friend to me who has never even seen you. I often think of you as\\r\\nsuch in my own thoughts. I wonder if you will laugh when I tell you I\\r\\nhave made a hero of you? For when people seem very sordid and mean and\\r\\nstupid (and it seems as if everybody was) then the thought will come\\r\\nlike a little crumb of comfort “well, Mark Twain isn’t anyway.” And it\\r\\ndoes really brighten me up.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see I have gotten an idea that you are a great, bright spirit\\r\\nof kindness and tenderness. One who can twist everybody’s-even your\\r\\nown-faults and absurdities into hearty laughs. Even the person mocked\\r\\nmust laugh! Oh, Dear! How often you have made me laugh! And yet as often\\r\\nyou have struck something infinite away down deep in my heart so that I\\r\\nwant to cry while half laughing!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this all means that I want to thank you and to tell you. “God always\\r\\nlove Mark Twain!” is often my wish. I dearly love to read books, and I\\r\\nnever tire of reading yours; they always have a charm for me. Good-bye,\\r\\nI am afraid I have not expressed what I feel. But at least I have tried.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Sincerely yours.\\r\\n                                   MARGARET M.----\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Clemens and family left Elmira October the 5th for New York City.\\r\\n     They remained at the Hotel Grosvenor until their sailing date,\\r\\n     October 24th.  A few days earlier, Mr. Frank Doubleday sent a volume\\r\\n     of Kipling’s poems and de Blowitz’s Memoirs for entertainment on the\\r\\n     ship.  Mark Twain’s acknowledgment follows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo F. N. Doubleday, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       THE GROSVENOR,\\r\\n                                                       October 12, ‘03.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR DOUBLEDAY,--The books came--ever so many thanks. I have been\\r\\nreading “The Bell Buoy” and “The Old Men” over and over again--my custom\\r\\nwith Kipling’s work-and saving up the rest for other leisurely and\\r\\nluxurious meals. A bell-buoy is a deeply impressive fellow-being. In\\r\\nthese many recent trips up and down the Sound in the Kanawha--[Mr.\\r\\nRogers’s yacht.]--he has talked to me nightly, sometimes in his pathetic\\r\\nand melancholy way, sometimes with his strenuous and urgent note, and I\\r\\ngot his meaning--now I have his words! No one but Kipling could do this\\r\\nstrong and vivid thing. Some day I hope to hear the poem chanted or\\r\\nsung--with the bell-buoy breaking in, out of the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Old Men,” delicious, isn’t it? And so comically true. I haven’t\\r\\narrived there yet, but I suppose I am on the way....\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   Yours ever,\\r\\n                                             MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\nP. S. Your letter has arrived. It makes me proud and glad--what Kipling\\r\\nsays. I hope Fate will fetch him to Florence while we are there. I would\\r\\nrather see him than any other man.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve let the Tarrytown house for a year. Man, you would never have\\r\\nbelieved a person could let a house in these times. That one’s for sale,\\r\\nthe Hartford one is sold. When we buy again may we--may I--be damned....\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve dipped into Blowitz and find him quaintly and curiously\\r\\ninteresting. I think he tells the straight truth, too. I knew him a\\r\\nlittle, 23 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The appreciative word which Kipling had sent Doubleday was: “I love\\r\\n     to think of the great and God-like Clemens.  He is the biggest man\\r\\n     you have on your side of the water by a damn sight, and don’t you\\r\\n     forget it.  Cervantes was a relation of his.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLIII. LETTERS OF 1904. TO VARIOUS PERSONS. LIFE IN VILLA QUARTO. DEATH\\r\\nOF MRS. CLEMENS. THE RETURN TO AMERICA.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Mrs. Clemens stood the voyage to Italy very well and, in due\\r\\n     time, the family were installed in the Villa Reale di\\r\\n     Quarto, the picturesque old Palace of Cosimo, a spacious,\\r\\n     luxurious place, even if not entirely cheerful or always\\r\\n     comfortable during the changeable Tuscan winter.\\r\\n     Congratulated in a letter from MacAlister in being in the\\r\\n     midst of Florentine sunshine, he answered: “Florentine\\r\\n     sunshine?  Bless you, there isn’t any.  We have heavy fogs\\r\\n     every morning, and rain all day.  This house is not merely\\r\\n     large, it is vast--therefore I think it must always lack the\\r\\n     home feeling.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     Neither was their landlady, the American wife of an Italian\\r\\n     count, all that could be desired.  From a letter to\\r\\n     Twichell, however, we learn that Mark Twain’s work was\\r\\n     progressing well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  VILLA DI QUARTO,\\r\\n                                             FLORENCE, Jan. 7, ‘04.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--... I have had a handsome success, in one way, here. I left\\r\\nNew York under a sort of half promise to furnish to the Harper magazines\\r\\n30,000 words this year. Magazining is difficult work because every third\\r\\npage represents 2 pages that you have put in the fire; (because you\\r\\nare nearly sure to start wrong twice) and so when you have finished\\r\\nan article and are willing to let it go to print it represents only 10\\r\\ncents a word instead of 30.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this time I had the curious (and unprecedented) luck to start right\\r\\nin each case. I turned out 37,000 words in 25 working days; and the\\r\\nreason I think I started right every time is, that not only have I\\r\\napproved and accepted the several articles, but the court of last resort\\r\\n(Livy) has done the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn many of the between-days I did some work, but only of an idle and not\\r\\nnecessarily necessary sort, since it will not see print until I am\\r\\ndead. I shall continue this (an hour per day) but the rest of the year\\r\\nI expect to put in on a couple of long books (half-completed ones.) No\\r\\nmore magazine-work hanging over my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis secluded and silent solitude this clean, soft air and this\\r\\nenchanting view of Florence, the great valley and the snow-mountains\\r\\nthat frame it are the right conditions for work. They are a persistent\\r\\ninspiration. To-day is very lovely; when the afternoon arrives there\\r\\nwill be a new picture every hour till dark, and each of them divine--or\\r\\nprogressing from divine to diviner and divinest. On this (second) floor\\r\\nClara’s room commands the finest; she keeps a window ten feet high wide\\r\\nopen all the time and frames it in. I go in from time to time, every day\\r\\nand trade sass for a look. The central detail is a distant and stately\\r\\nsnow-hump that rises above and behind blackforested hills, and its\\r\\nsloping vast buttresses, velvety and sun-polished with purple shadows\\r\\nbetween, make the sort of picture we knew that time we walked in\\r\\nSwitzerland in the days of our youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish I could show your letter to Livy--but she must wait a week or so\\r\\nfor it. I think I told you she had a prostrating week of tonsillitis a\\r\\nmonth ago; she has remained very feeble ever since, and confined to the\\r\\nbed of course, but we allow ourselves to believe she will regain the\\r\\nlost ground in another month. Her physician is Professor Grocco--she\\r\\ncould not have a better. And she has a very good trained nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove to all of you from all of us. And to all of our dear Hartford\\r\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    MARK\\r\\n\\r\\nP. S. 3 days later.\\r\\n\\r\\nLivy is as remarkable as ever. The day I wrote you--that night, I\\r\\nmean--she had a bitter attack of gout or rheumatism occupying the whole\\r\\nleft arm from shoulder to fingers, accompanied by fever. The pains\\r\\nracked her 50 or 60 hours; they have departed, now--and already she is\\r\\nplanning a trip to Egypt next fall, and a winter’s sojourn there! This\\r\\nis life in her yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will be surprised that I was willing to do so much\\r\\nmagazine-writing--a thing I have always been chary about--but I had good\\r\\nreasons. Our expenses have been so prodigious for a year and a half,\\r\\nand are still so prodigious, that Livy was worrying altogether too much\\r\\nabout them, and doing a very dangerous amount of lying awake on their\\r\\naccount. It was necessary to stop that, and it is now stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, she is remarkable, Joe. Her rheumatic attack set me to cursing and\\r\\nswearing, without limit as to time or energy, but it merely concentrated\\r\\nher patience and her unconquerable fortitude. It is the difference\\r\\nbetween us. I can’t count the different kinds of ailments which have\\r\\nassaulted her in this fiendish year and a half--and I forgive none of\\r\\nthem--but here she comes up again as bright and fresh and enterprising\\r\\nas ever, and goes to planning about Egypt, with a hope and a confidence\\r\\nwhich are to me amazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nClara is calling for me--we have to go into town and pay calls.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     In Florence, that winter, Clemens began dictating to his secretary\\r\\n     some autobiographical chapters.  This was the work which was “not to\\r\\n     see print until I am dead.”  He found it a pleasant, lazy occupation\\r\\n     and wrote his delight in it to Howells in a letter which seems not\\r\\n     to have survived.  In his reply, Howells wrote: “You do stir me\\r\\n     mightily with the hope of dictating and I will try it when I get the\\r\\n     chance.  But there is the tempermental difference.  You are dramatic\\r\\n     and unconscious; you count the thing more than yourself; I am cursed\\r\\n     with consciousness to the core, and can’t say myself out; I am\\r\\n     always saying myself in, and setting myself above all that I say, as\\r\\n     of more worth.  Lately I have felt as if I were rotting with\\r\\n     egotism.  I don’t admire myself; I am sick of myself; but I can’t\\r\\n     think of anything else.  Here I am at it now, when I ought to be\\r\\n     rejoicing with you at the blessing you have found....  I’d like,\\r\\n     immensely, to read your autobiography.  You always rather bewildered\\r\\n     me by your veracity, and I fancy you may tell the truth about\\r\\n     yourself.  But all of it?  The black truth which we all know of\\r\\n     ourselves in our hearts, or only the whity-brown truth of the\\r\\n     pericardium, or the nice, whitened truth of the shirtfront?  Even\\r\\n     you won’t tell the black heart’s--truth.  The man who could do it\\r\\n     would be famed to the last day the sun shone upon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     We gather from Mark Twain’s answer that he was not deceiving himself\\r\\n     in the matter of his confessions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo W. D. Howells, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             VILLA DI QUARTO, FLORENCE,\\r\\n                                                       March 14, ‘04.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR HOWELLS,--Yes, I set up the safeguards, in the first day’s\\r\\ndictating; taking this position: that an autobiography is the truest of\\r\\nall books; for while it inevitably consists mainly of extinctions of the\\r\\ntruth, shirkings of the truth, partial revealments of the truth, with\\r\\nhardly an instance of plain straight truth, the remorseless truth is\\r\\nthere, between the lines, where the author is raking dust upon it,\\r\\nthe result being that the reader knows the author in spite of his wily\\r\\ndiligences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summer in England! you can’t ask better luck than that. Then you\\r\\nwill run over to Florence; we shall all be hungry to see you-all. We are\\r\\nhunting for another villa, (this one is plenty large enough but has no\\r\\nroom in it) but even if we find it I am afraid it will be months before\\r\\nwe can move Mrs. Clemens. Of course it will. But it comforts us to let\\r\\non that we think otherwise, and these pretensions help to keep hope\\r\\nalive in her.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Good-bye, with love, Amen.\\r\\n                              Yours ever\\r\\n                                        MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     News came of the death of Henry M.  Stanley, one of Mark Twain’s\\r\\n     oldest friends.  Clemens once said that he had met Stanley in St.\\r\\n     Louis where he (Clemens) had delivered a lecture which Stanley had\\r\\n     reported.  In the following letter he fixes the date of their\\r\\n     meeting as early in 1867, which would be immediately after Mark\\r\\n     Twain’s return from California, and just prior to the Quaker City\\r\\n     excursion--a fact which is interesting only because it places the\\r\\n     two men together when each was at the very beginning of a great\\r\\n     career.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Lady Stanley, in England:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   VILLA DI QUARTO, FIRENZE, May 11, ‘04.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR LADY STANLEY,--I have lost a dear and honored friend--how fast\\r\\nthey fall about me now, in my age! The world has lost a tried and proved\\r\\nhero. And you--what have you lost? It is beyond estimate--we who know\\r\\nyou, and what he was to you, know that. How far he stretches across my\\r\\nlife! I knew him when his work was all before him five years before the\\r\\ngreat day that he wrote his name far-away up on the blue of the sky for\\r\\nthe world to see and applaud and remember; I have known him as friend\\r\\nand intimate ever since. It is 37 years. I have known no other friend\\r\\nand intimate so long, except John Hay--a friendship which dates from the\\r\\nsame year and the same half of it, the first half of 1867. I grieve with\\r\\nyou and with your family, dear Lady Stanley, it is all I can do; but\\r\\nthat I do out of my heart. It would be we, instead of I, if Mrs. Clemens\\r\\nknew, but in all these 20 months that she has lain a prisoner in her bed\\r\\nwe have hidden from her all things that could sadden her. Many a friend\\r\\nis gone whom she still asks about and still thinks is living.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn deepest sympathy I beg the privilege of signing myself\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Your friend,\\r\\n                                        S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        VILLA DI QUARTO, May 11, ‘04\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--Yours has this moment arrived--just as I was finishing a note\\r\\nto poor Lady Stanley. I believe the last country-house visit we paid in\\r\\nEngland was to Stanley’s. Lord, how my friends and acquaintances fall\\r\\nabout me now, in my gray-headed days! Vereschagin, Mommsen, Dvorak,\\r\\nLenbach, Jokai--all so recently, and now Stanley. I had known Stanley\\r\\n37 years. Goodness, who is it I haven’t known! As a rule the necrologies\\r\\nfind me personally interested--when they treat of old stagers. Generally\\r\\nwhen a man dies who is worth cabling, it happens that I have run across\\r\\nhim somewhere, some time or other.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, say! Down by the Laurentian Library there’s a marble image that\\r\\nhas been sitting on its pedestal some 450 Years, if my dates are\\r\\nright--Cosimo I. I’ve seen the back of it many a time, but not the\\r\\nfront; but yesterday I twisted my head around after we had driven by,\\r\\nand the profane exclamation burst from my mouth before I could think:\\r\\n“there’s Chauncey Depew!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI mean to get a photo of it--and use it if it confirms yesterday’s\\r\\nconviction. That’s a very nice word from the Catholic Magazine and I am\\r\\nglad you sent it. I mean to show it to my priest--we are very fond of\\r\\nhim. He is a stealing man, and is also learnedly scientific. He invented\\r\\nthe thing which records the seismatic disturbances, for the peoples of\\r\\nthe earth. And he’s an astronomer and has an observatory of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, many’s the cry I have, over reflecting that maybe we could have had\\r\\nYoung Harmony for Livy, and didn’t have wit enough to think of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of Livy reminds me that your inquiry arrives at a good time\\r\\n(unberufen) It has been weeks (I don’t know how many!) since we could\\r\\nhave said a hopeful word, but this morning Katy came the minute the\\r\\nday-nurse came on watch and said words of a strange and long-forgotten\\r\\nsound: “Mr. Clemens, Mrs. Clemens is really and truly better!--anybody\\r\\ncan see it; she sees it herself; and last night at 9 o’clock she said\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere--it is heart-warming, it is splendid, it is sublime; let us\\r\\nenjoy it, let us make the most of it today--and bet not a farthing on\\r\\ntomorrow. The tomorrows have nothing for us. Too many times they have\\r\\nbreathed the word of promise to our ear and broken it to our hope. We\\r\\ntake no tomorrow’s word any more.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou’ve done a wonder, Joe: you’ve written a letter that can be sent in\\r\\nto Livy--that doesn’t often happen, when either a friend or a stranger\\r\\nwrites. You did whirl in a P. S. that wouldn’t do, but you wrote it on\\r\\na margin of a page in such a way that I was able to clip off the margin\\r\\nclear across both pages, and now Livy won’t perceive that the sheet\\r\\nisn’t the same size it used to was. It was about Aldrich’s son, and\\r\\nI came near forgetting to remove it. It should have been written on a\\r\\nloose strip and enclosed. That son died on the 5th of March and Aldrich\\r\\nwrote me on the night before that his minutes were numbered. On the 18th\\r\\nLivy asked after that patient, and I was prepared, and able to give her\\r\\na grateful surprise by telling her “the Aldriches are no longer uneasy\\r\\nabout him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI do wish I could have been present and heard Charley Clark. When he\\r\\ncan’t light up a dark place nobody can.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    With lots of love to you all.\\r\\n                                                  MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Mrs. Clemens had her bad days and her good days-days when there\\r\\n     seemed no ray of light, and others that seemed almost to promise\\r\\n     recovery.  The foregoing letter to Twichell, and the one which\\r\\n     follows, to Richard Watson Gilder, reflect the hope and fear that\\r\\n     daily and hourly alternated at Villa Quarto\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Richard Watson Gilder, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        VILLA DI QUARTO, FLORENCE,\\r\\n                                             May 12, ‘04.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR GILDER,--A friend of ours (the Baroness de Nolda) was here this\\r\\nafternoon and wanted a note of introduction to the Century, for she has\\r\\nsomething to sell to you in case you’ll want to make her an offer after\\r\\nseeing a sample of the goods. I said “With pleasure: get the goods\\r\\nready, send the same to me, I will have Jean type-write them, then I\\r\\nwill mail them to the Century and tonight I will write the note to Mr.\\r\\nGilder and start it along. Also write me a letter embodying what\\r\\nyou have been saying to me about the goods and your proposed plan of\\r\\narranging and explaining them, and I will forward that to Gilder too.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the Baroness. She is a German; 30 years old; was married at 17;\\r\\nis very pretty-indeed I might say very pretty; has a lot of sons (5)\\r\\nrunning up from seven to 12 years old. Her husband is a Russian. They\\r\\nlive half the time in Russia and the other half in Florence, and supply\\r\\npopulation alternately to the one country and then to the other. Of\\r\\ncourse it is a family that speaks languages. This occurs at their\\r\\ntable--I know it by experience: It is Babel come again. The other day,\\r\\nwhen no guests were present to keep order, the tribes were all talking\\r\\nat once, and 6 languages were being traded in; at last the littlest boy\\r\\nlost his temper and screamed out at the top of his voice, with angry\\r\\nsobs: “Mais, vraiment, io non capisco gar nichts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baroness is a little afraid of her English, therefore she will write\\r\\nher remarks in French--I said there’s a plenty of translators in New\\r\\nYork. Examine her samples and drop her a line.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two entire days, now, we have not been anxious about Mrs. Clemens\\r\\n(unberufen). After 20 months of bed-ridden solitude and bodily misery\\r\\nshe all of a sudden ceases to be a pallid shrunken shadow, and looks\\r\\nbright and young and pretty. She remains what she always was, the most\\r\\nwonderful creature of fortitude, patience, endurance and recuperative\\r\\npower that ever was. But ah, dear, it won’t last; this fiendish malady\\r\\nwill play new treacheries upon her, and I shall go back to my prayers\\r\\nagain--unutterable from any pulpit!\\r\\n\\r\\n                    With love to you and yours,\\r\\n                                             S. L. C.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 13 10 A.M. I have just paid one of my pair of permitted 2 minutes\\r\\nvisits per day to the sick room. And found what I have learned to\\r\\nexpect--retrogression, and that pathetic something in the eye which\\r\\nbetrays the secret of a waning hope.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The year of the World’s Fair had come, and an invitation from Gov.\\r\\n     Francis, of Missouri, came to Mark Twain in Florence, personally\\r\\n     inviting him to attend the great celebration and carry off first\\r\\n     prize.  We may believe that Clemens felt little in the spirit of\\r\\n     humor, but to such an invitation he must send a cheerful, even if\\r\\n     disappointing, answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Gov. Francis, of Missouri:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             VILLA DI QUARTO, FIRENZE,\\r\\n                                                       May 26, 1904.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR GOVERNOR FRANCIS,--It has been a dear wish of mine to exhibit\\r\\nmyself at the Great Fair and get a prize, but circumstances beyond my\\r\\ncontrol have interfered, and I must remain in Florence. Although I\\r\\nhave never taken prizes anywhere else I used to take them at school in\\r\\nMissouri half a century ago, and I ought to be able to repeat, now, if\\r\\nI could have a chance. I used to get the medal for good spelling, every\\r\\nweek, and I could have had the medal for good conduct if there hadn’t\\r\\nbeen so much corruption in Missouri in those days; still, I got it\\r\\nseveral times by trading medals and giving boot. I am willing to give\\r\\nboot now, if--however, those days are forever gone by in Missouri,\\r\\nand perhaps it is better so. Nothing ever stops the way it was in this\\r\\nchangeable world. Although I cannot be at the Fair, I am going to be\\r\\nrepresented there anyway, by a portrait, by Professor Gelli. You will\\r\\nfind it excellent. Good judges here say it is better than the original.\\r\\nThey say it has all the merits of the original and keeps still, besides.\\r\\nIt sounds like flattery, but it is just true.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose you will get a prize, because you have created the most\\r\\nprodigious and in all ways most wonderful Fair the planet has ever seen.\\r\\nVery well, you have indeed earned it: and with it the gratitude of the\\r\\nState and the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                                                  MARK TWAIN\\r\\n\\r\\n     It was only a few days after the foregoing was written that death\\r\\n     entered Villa Quarto--unexpectedly at last--for with the first June\\r\\n     days Mrs. Clemens had seemed really to improve.  It was on Sunday,\\r\\n     June 5th, that the end came.  Clemens, with his daughter Jean, had\\r\\n     returned from a long drive, during which they had visited a Villa\\r\\n     with the thought of purchase.  On their return they were told that\\r\\n     their patient had been better that afternoon than for three months.\\r\\n     Yet it was only a few hours later that she left them, so suddenly\\r\\n     and quietly that even those near her did not at first realize that\\r\\n     she was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo W. D. Howells, in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        VILLA DI QUARTO, FLORENCE,\\r\\n                                             June 6, ‘94. [1904]\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR HOWELLS,--Last night at 9.20 I entered Mrs. Clemens’s room to say\\r\\nthe usual goodnight--and she was dead--tho’ no one knew it. She had been\\r\\ncheerfully talking, a moment before. She was sitting up in bed--she had\\r\\nnot lain down for months--and Katie and the nurse were supporting her.\\r\\nThey supposed she had fainted, and they were holding the oxygen pipe to\\r\\nher mouth, expecting to revive her. I bent over her and looked in her\\r\\nface, and I think I spoke--I was surprised and troubled that she did\\r\\nnot notice me. Then we understood, and our hearts broke. How poor we are\\r\\ntoday!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how thankful I am that her persecutions are ended. I would not call\\r\\nher back if I could.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, treasured in her worn old Testament, I found a dear and gentle\\r\\nletter from you, dated Far Rockaway, Sept. 13, 1896, about our poor\\r\\nSusy’s death. I am tired and old; I wish I were with Livy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI send my love-and hers-to you all.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   S. L. C.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     In a letter to Twichell he wrote: “How sweet she was in death; how\\r\\n     young, how beautiful, how like her dear, girlish self cf thirty\\r\\n     years ago; not a gray hair showing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     The family was now without plans for the future until they\\r\\n     remembered the summer home of R. W. Gilder, at Tyringham,\\r\\n     Massachusetts, and the possibility of finding lodgment for\\r\\n     themselves in that secluded corner of New England.  Clemens wrote\\r\\n     without delay, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo R. W. Gilder, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             VILLA DI QUARTO, FLORENCE,\\r\\n                                                  June 7, ‘04.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR GILDER FAMILY,--I have been worrying and worrying to know what to\\r\\ndo: at last I went to the girls with an idea: to ask the Gilders to get\\r\\nus shelter near their summer home. It was the first time they have not\\r\\nshaken their heads. So to-morrow I will cable to you and shall hope to\\r\\nbe in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour ago the best heart that ever beat for me and mine went silent\\r\\nout of this house, and I am as one who wanders and has lost his way. She\\r\\nwho is gone was our head, she was our hands. We are now trying to make\\r\\nplans--we: we who have never made a plan before, nor ever needed to. If\\r\\nshe could speak to us she would make it all simple and easy with a word,\\r\\nand our perplexities would vanish away. If she had known she was near to\\r\\ndeath she would have told us where to go and what to do: but she was not\\r\\nsuspecting, neither were we. (She had been chatting cheerfully a moment\\r\\nbefore, and in an instant she was gone from us and we did not know it.\\r\\nWe were not alarmed, we did not know anything had happened. It was a\\r\\nblessed death--she passed away without knowing it.) She was all our\\r\\nriches and she is gone: she was our breath, she was our life and now we\\r\\nare nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe send you our love--and with it the love of you that was in her heart\\r\\nwhen she died.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         S.  L.  CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Howells wrote his words of sympathy, adding: “The character which\\r\\n     now remains a memory was one of the most perfect ever formed on the\\r\\n     earth,” and again, after having received Clemens’s letter: “I cannot\\r\\n     speak of your wife’s having kept that letter of mine where she did.\\r\\n     You know how it must humiliate a man in his unworthiness to have\\r\\n     anything of his so consecrated.  She hallowed what she touched, far\\r\\n     beyond priests.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo W. D. Howells, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        VILLA DI QUARTO, ‘04.\\r\\n                                             June 12, 6 p. m.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR HOWELLS,--We have to sit and hold our hands and wait--in the\\r\\nsilence and solitude of this prodigious house; wait until June 25, then\\r\\nwe go to Naples and sail in the Prince Oscar the 26th. There is a\\r\\nship 12 days earlier (but we came in that one.) I see Clara twice a\\r\\nday--morning and evening--greeting--nothing more is allowed. She keeps\\r\\nher bed, and says nothing. She has not cried yet. I wish she could cry.\\r\\nIt would break Livy’s heart to see Clara. We excuse ourselves from\\r\\nall the friends that call--though of course only intimates come.\\r\\nIntimates--but they are not the old old friends, the friends of the old,\\r\\nold times when we laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShall we ever laugh again? If I could only see a dog that I knew in\\r\\nthe old times! and could put my arms around his neck and tell him all,\\r\\neverything, and ease my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink--in 3 hours it will be a week!--and soon a month; and by and by a\\r\\nyear. How fast our dead fly from us.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe loved you so, and was always as pleased as a child with any notice\\r\\nyou took of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon your wife will be with you, oh fortunate man! And John, whom mine\\r\\nwas so fond of. The sight of him was such a delight to her. Lord, the\\r\\nold friends, how dear they are.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   S. L.

I am bewildered and must remain so for a time\\r\\nlonger. It was so sudden, so unexpected. Imagine a man worth a hundred\\r\\nmillions who finds himself suddenly penniless and fifty million in debt\\r\\nin his old age.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was richer than any other person in the world, and now I am that\\r\\npauper without peer. Some day I will tell you about it, not now.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                            MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     A tide of condolence flowed in from all parts of the world.  It was\\r\\n     impossible to answer all.  Only a few who had been their closest\\r\\n     friends received a written line, but the little printed\\r\\n     acknowledgment which was returned was no mere formality.  It was a\\r\\n     heartfelt, personal word.\\r\\n\\r\\n     They arrived in America in July, and were accompanied by Twichell to\\r\\n     Elmira, and on the 14th Mrs. Clemens was laid to rest by the side of\\r\\n     Susy and little Langdon.  R. W. Gilder had arranged for them to\\r\\n     occupy, for the summer, a cottage on his place at Tyringham, in the\\r\\n     Berkshire Hills.  By November they were at the Grosvenor, in New\\r\\n     York, preparing to establish themselves in a house which they had\\r\\n     taken on the corner of Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue--Number 21.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo F. N. Doubleday, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR DOUBLEDAY,--I did not know you were going to England: I would have\\r\\nfreighted you with such messages of homage and affection to Kipling. And\\r\\nI would have pressed his hand, through you, for his sympathy with me in\\r\\nmy crushing loss, as expressed by him in his letter to Gilder. You know\\r\\nmy feeling for Kipling and that it antedates that expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was glad that the boys came here to invite me to the house-warming and\\r\\nI think they understood why a man in the shadow of a calamity like mine\\r\\ncould not go.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has taken three months to repair and renovate our house--corner of\\r\\n9th and 5th Avenue, but I shall be in it in io or 15 days hence. Much\\r\\nof the furniture went into it today (from Hartford). We have not seen\\r\\nit for 13 years. Katy Leary, our old housekeeper, who has been in our\\r\\nservice more than 24 years, cried when she told me about it to-day. She\\r\\nsaid “I had forgotten it was so beautiful, and it brought Mrs. Clemens\\r\\nright back to me--in that old time when she was so young and lovely.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJean and my secretary and the servants whom we brought from Italy\\r\\nbecause Mrs. Clemens liked them so well, are still keeping house in the\\r\\nBerkshire hills--and waiting. Clara (nervously wrecked by her mother’s\\r\\ndeath) is in the hands of a specialist in 69th St., and I shall not be\\r\\nallowed to have any communication with her--even telephone--for a year.\\r\\nI am in this comfortable little hotel, and still in bed--for I dasn’t\\r\\nbudge till I’m safe from my pet devil, bronchitis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsn’t it pathetic? One hour and ten minutes before Mrs. Clemens died\\r\\nI was saying to her “To-day, after five months search, I’ve found the\\r\\nvilla that will content you: to-morrow you will examine the plans and\\r\\ngive it your consent and I will buy it.” Her eyes danced with pleasure,\\r\\nfor she longed for a home of her own. And there, on that morrow, she lay\\r\\nwhite and cold. And unresponsive to my reverent caresses--a new thing\\r\\nto me and a new thing to her; that had not happened before in five and\\r\\nthirty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am coming to see you and Mrs. Doubleday by and bye. She loved and\\r\\nhonored Mrs. Doubleday and her work.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   Always yours,\\r\\n                                                  MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     It was a presidential year and the air was thick with politics.\\r\\n     Mark Twain was no longer actively interested in the political\\r\\n     situation; he was only disheartened by the hollowness and pretense\\r\\n     of office-seeking, and the methods of office-seekers in general.\\r\\n     Grieved that Twichell should still pin his faith to any party when\\r\\n     all parties were so obviously venal and time-serving, he wrote in\\r\\n     outspoken and rather somber protest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             THE GROSVENOR, Nov. 4, ‘04.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, dear! get out of that sewer--party politics--dear Joe. At least\\r\\nwith your mouth. We hail only two men who could make speeches for their\\r\\nparties and preserve their honor and their dignity. One of them is dead.\\r\\nPossibly there were four. I am sorry for John Hay; sorry and ashamed.\\r\\nAnd yet I know he couldn’t help it. He wears the collar, and he had to\\r\\npay the penalty. Certainly he had no more desire to stand up before\\r\\na mob of confiding human incapables and debauch them than you had.\\r\\nCertainly he took no more real pleasure in distorting history,\\r\\nconcealing facts, propagating immoralities, and appealing to the sordid\\r\\nside of human nature than did you; but he was his party’s property, and\\r\\nhe had to climb away down and do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting, wonderfully interesting--the miracles which\\r\\nparty-politics can do with a man’s mental and moral make-up. Look\\r\\nat McKinley, Roosevelt, and yourself: in private life spotless\\r\\nin character; honorable, honest, just, humane, generous; scorning\\r\\ntrickeries, treacheries, suppressions of the truth, mistranslations of\\r\\nthe meanings of facts, the filching of credit earned by another, the\\r\\ncondoning of crime, the glorifying of base acts: in public political\\r\\nlife the reverse of all this.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcKinley was a silverite--you concealed it. Roosevelt was a\\r\\nsilverite--you concealed it. Parker was a silverite--you publish it.\\r\\nAlong with a shudder and a warning: “He was unsafe then. Is he any safer\\r\\nnow?”\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe, even I could be guilty of such a thing as that--if I were in\\r\\nparty-politics; I really believe it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Cleveland gave the country the gold standard; by implication you\\r\\ncredit the matter to the Republican party.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy implication you prove the whole annual pension-scoop, concealing the\\r\\nfact that the bulk of the money goes to people who in no way deserve it.\\r\\nYou imply that all the batteners upon this bribery-fund are Republicans.\\r\\nAn indiscreet confession, since about half of them must have been\\r\\nDemocrats before they were bought.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou as good as praise Order 78. It is true you do not shout, and you do\\r\\nnot linger, you only whisper and skip--still, what little you do in the\\r\\nmatter is complimentary to the crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt means, if it means anything, that our outlying properties will all\\r\\nbe given up by the Democrats, and our flag hauled down. All of them? Not\\r\\nonly the properties stolen by Mr. McKinley and Mr. Roosevelt, but the\\r\\nproperties honestly acquired? Joe, did you believe that hardy statement\\r\\nwhen you made it? Yet you made it, and there it stands in permanent\\r\\nprint. Now what moral law would suffer if we should give up the stolen\\r\\nones? But--\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know our standard-bearer. He will maintain all that we have\\r\\ngained”--by whatever process. Land, I believe you!\\r\\n\\r\\nBy George, Joe, you are as handy at the game as if you had been in\\r\\ntraining for it all your life. Your campaign Address is built from the\\r\\nground up upon the oldest and best models. There isn’t a paragraph in it\\r\\nwhose facts or morals will wash--not even a sentence, I believe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you will soon be out of this. You didn’t want to do it--that is\\r\\nsufficiently apparent, thanks be!--but you couldn’t well get out of it.\\r\\nIn a few days you will be out of it, and then you can fumigate yourself\\r\\nand take up your legitimate work again and resume your clean and\\r\\nwholesome private character once more and be happy--and useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know I ought to hand you some guff, now, as propitiation and apology\\r\\nfor these reproaches, but on the whole I believe I won’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have inquired, and find that Mitsikuri does not arrive here until\\r\\nto-morrow night. I shall watch out, and telephone again, for I greatly\\r\\nwant to see him.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Always Yours,\\r\\n                                   MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\nP. S.--Nov, 4. I wish I could learn to remember that it is unjust and\\r\\ndishonorable to put blame upon the human race for any of its acts.\\r\\nFor it did not make itself, it did not make its nature, it is merely\\r\\na machine, it is moved wholly by outside influences, it has no hand in\\r\\ncreating the outside influences nor in choosing which of them it will\\r\\nwelcome or reject, its performance is wholly automatic, it has no more\\r\\nmastership nor authority over its mind than it has over its stomach,\\r\\nwhich receives material from the outside and does as it pleases with\\r\\nit, indifferent to it’s proprietor’s suggestions, even, let alone his\\r\\ncommands; wherefore, whatever the machine does--so called crimes and\\r\\ninfamies included--is the personal act of its Maker, and He, solely,\\r\\nis responsible. I wish I could learn to pity the human race instead of\\r\\ncensuring it and laughing at it; and I could, if the outside influences\\r\\nof old habit were not so strong upon my machine. It vexes me to catch\\r\\nmyself praising the clean private citizen Roosevelt, and blaming the\\r\\nsoiled President Roosevelt, when I know that neither praise nor blame\\r\\nis due to him for any thought or word or deed of his, he being merely a\\r\\nhelpless and irresponsible coffee-mill ground by the hand of God.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Through a misunderstanding, Clemens, something more than a year\\r\\n     earlier, had severed his connection with the Players’ Club, of which\\r\\n     he had been one of the charter members.  Now, upon his return to New\\r\\n     York, a number of his friends joined in an invitation to him to\\r\\n     return.  It was not exactly a letter they sent, but a bit of an old\\r\\n     Scotch song--\\r\\n\\r\\n                            “To Mark Twain\\r\\n                                from\\r\\n                             The Clansmen.\\r\\n                         Will ye no come back again,\\r\\n                         Will ye no come back again?\\r\\n                         Better lo’ed ye canna be.\\r\\n                         Will ye no come back again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n     Those who signed it were David Monroe, of the North American Review;\\r\\n     Robert Reid, the painter, and about thirty others of the Round Table\\r\\n     Group, so called because its members were accustomed to lunching at\\r\\n     a large round table in a bay window of the Player dining-room.  Mark\\r\\n     Twain’s reply was prompt and heartfelt.  He wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Robt. Reid and the Others:\\r\\n\\r\\nWELL-BELOVED,--Surely those lovely verses went to Prince Charley’s\\r\\nheart, if he had one, and certainly they have gone to mine. I shall\\r\\nbe glad and proud to come back again after such a moving and beautiful\\r\\ncompliment as this from comrades whom I have loved so long. I hope you\\r\\ncan poll the necessary vote; I know you will try, at any rate. It will\\r\\nbe many months before I can foregather with you, for this black border\\r\\nis not perfunctory, not a convention; it symbolizes the loss of one\\r\\nwhose memory is the only thing I worship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not necessary for me to thank you--and words could not deliver\\r\\nwhat I feel, anyway. I will put the contents of your envelope in the\\r\\nsmall casket where I keep the things which have become sacred to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  S.  L.

LETTERS OF 1905. TO TWICHELL, MR. DUNEKA AND OTHERS. POLITICS AND\\r\\nHUMANITY. A SUMMER AT DUBLIN. MARK TWAIN AT 70.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In 1884 Mark Twain had abandoned the Republican Party to vote for\\r\\n     Cleveland.  He believed the party had become corrupt, and to his\\r\\n     last day it was hard for him to see anything good in Republican\\r\\n     policies or performance.  He was a personal friend of Theodore\\r\\n     Roosevelt’s but, as we have seen in a former letter, Roosevelt the\\r\\n     politician rarely found favor in his eyes.  With or without\\r\\n     justification, most of the President’s political acts invited his\\r\\n     caustic sarcasm and unsparing condemnation.  Another letter to\\r\\n     Twichell of this time affords a fair example.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       Feb. 16, ‘05.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--I knew I had in me somewhere a definite feeling about the\\r\\nPresident if I could only find the words to define it with. Here they\\r\\nare, to a hair--from Leonard Jerome: “For twenty years I have loved\\r\\nRoosevelt the man and hated Roosevelt the statesman and politician.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s mighty good. Every time, in 25 years, that I have met Roosevelt the\\r\\nman, a wave of welcome has streaked through me with the hand-grip; but\\r\\nwhenever (as a rule) I meet Roosevelt the statesman and politician, I\\r\\nfind him destitute of morals and not respectworthy. It is plain that\\r\\nwhere his political self and his party self are concerned he has nothing\\r\\nresembling a conscience; that under those inspirations he is naively\\r\\nindifferent to the restraints of duty and even unaware of them; ready\\r\\nto kick the Constitution into the back yard whenever it gets in the way;\\r\\nand whenever he smells a vote, not only willing but eager to buy it,\\r\\ngive extravagant rates for it and pay the bill not out of his own pocket\\r\\nor the party’s, but out of the nation’s, by cold pillage. As per Order\\r\\n78 and the appropriation of the Indian trust funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Roosevelt is excusable--I recognize it and (ought to) concede it.\\r\\nWe are all insane, each in his own way, and with insanity goes\\r\\nirresponsibility. Theodore the man is sane; in fairness we ought to\\r\\nkeep in mind that Theodore, as statesman and politician, is insane and\\r\\nirresponsible.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not throw these enlightenments aside, but study them, let them raise\\r\\nyou to higher planes and make you better. You taught me in my callow\\r\\ndays, let me pay back the debt now in my old age out of a thesaurus with\\r\\nwisdom smelted from the golden ores of experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Ever yours for sweetness and light\\r\\n                                                            MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The next letter to Twichell takes up politics and humanity in\\r\\n     general, in a manner complimentary to neither.  Mark Twain was never\\r\\n     really a pessimist, but he had pessimistic intervals, such as come\\r\\n     to most of us in life’s later years, and at such times he let\\r\\n     himself go without stint concerning “the damned human race,” as he\\r\\n     called it, usually with a manifest sense of indignation that he\\r\\n     should be a member of it.  In much of his later writing\\r\\n     --A Mysterious Stranger for example--he said his say with but small\\r\\n     restraint, and certainly in his purely intellectual moments he was\\r\\n     likely to be a pessimist of the most extreme type, capably damning\\r\\n     the race and the inventor of it.  Yet, at heart, no man loved his\\r\\n     kind more genuinely, or with deeper compassion, than Mark Twain,\\r\\n     perhaps for its very weaknesses.  It was only that he had intervals\\r\\n     --frequent intervals, and rather long ones--when he did not admire\\r\\n     it, and was still more doubtful as to the ways of providence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       March 14, ‘05.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR JOE,--I have a Puddn’head maxim:\\r\\n\\r\\n“When a man is a pessimist before 48 he knows too much; if he is an\\r\\noptimist after it, he knows too little.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is with contentment, therefore, that I reflect that I am better and\\r\\nwiser than you. Joe, you seem to be dealing in “bulks,” now; the “bulk”\\r\\n of the farmers and U. S. Senators are “honest.” As regards purchase and\\r\\nsale with money? Who doubts it? Is that the only measure of honesty?\\r\\nAren’t there a dozen kinds of honesty which can’t be measured by the\\r\\nmoney-standard? Treason is treason--and there’s more than one form of\\r\\nit; the money-form is but one of them. When a person is disloyal to any\\r\\nconfessed duty, he is plainly and simply dishonest, and knows it; knows\\r\\nit, and is privately troubled about it and not proud of himself. Judged\\r\\nby this standard--and who will challenge the validity of it?--there\\r\\nisn’t an honest man in Connecticut, nor in the Senate, nor anywhere\\r\\nelse. I do not even except myself, this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAm I finding fault with you and the rest of the populace? No--I assure\\r\\nyou I am not. For I know the human race’s limitations, and this makes it\\r\\nmy duty--my pleasant duty--to be fair to it. Each person in it is honest\\r\\nin one or several ways, but no member of it is honest in all the ways\\r\\nrequired by--by what? By his own standard. Outside of that, as I look at\\r\\nit, there is no obligation upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAm I honest? I give you my word of honor (private) I am not. For seven\\r\\nyears I have suppressed a book which my conscience tells me I ought\\r\\nto publish. I hold it a duty to publish it. There are other difficult\\r\\nduties which I am equal to, but I am not equal to that one. Yes, even I\\r\\nam dishonest. Not in many ways, but in some. Forty-one, I think it is.\\r\\nWe are certainly all honest in one or several ways--every man in the\\r\\nworld--though I have reason to think I am the only one whose black-list\\r\\nruns so light. Sometimes I feel lonely enough in this lofty solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, oh, yes, I am not overlooking the “steady progress from age to age\\r\\nof the coming of the kingdom of God and righteousness.” “From age to\\r\\nage”--yes, it describes that giddy gait. I (and the rocks) will not live\\r\\nto see it arrive, but that is all right--it will arrive, it surely will.\\r\\nBut you ought not to be always ironically apologizing for the Deity.\\r\\nIf that thing is going to arrive, it is inferable that He wants it to\\r\\narrive; and so it is not quite kind of you, and it hurts me, to see you\\r\\nflinging sarcasms at the gait of it. And yet it would not be fair in\\r\\nme not to admit that the sarcasms are deserved. When the Deity wants\\r\\na thing, and after working at it for “ages and ages” can’t show even a\\r\\nshade of progress toward its accomplishment, we--well, we don’t laugh,\\r\\nbut it is only because we dasn’t. The source of “righteousness”--is in\\r\\nthe heart? Yes. And engineered and directed by the brain? Yes. Well,\\r\\nhistory and tradition testify that the heart is just about what it was\\r\\nin the beginning; it has undergone no shade of change. Its good and evil\\r\\nimpulses and their consequences are the same today that they were in Old\\r\\nBible times, in Egyptian times, in Greek times, in Middle Age times, in\\r\\nTwentieth Century times. There has been no change.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, the brain has undergone no change. It is what it always was.\\r\\nThere are a few good brains and a multitude of poor ones. It was so in\\r\\nOld Bible times and in all other times--Greek, Roman, Middle Ages and\\r\\nTwentieth Century. Among the savages--all the savages--the average brain\\r\\nis as competent as the average brain here or elsewhere. I will prove it\\r\\nto you, some time, if you like. And there are great brains among them,\\r\\ntoo. I will prove that also, if you like.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, the 19th century made progress--the first progress after “ages\\r\\nand ages”--colossal progress. In what? Materialities. Prodigious\\r\\nacquisitions were made in things which add to the comfort of many and\\r\\nmake life harder for as many more. But the addition to righteousness? Is\\r\\nthat discoverable? I think not. The materialities were not invented in\\r\\nthe interest of righteousness; that there is more righteousness in the\\r\\nworld because of them than there, was before, is hardly demonstrable,\\r\\nI think. In Europe and America, there is a vast change (due to them)\\r\\nin ideals--do you admire it? All Europe and all America, are feverishly\\r\\nscrambling for money. Money is the supreme ideal--all others take tenth\\r\\nplace with the great bulk of the nations named. Money-lust has always\\r\\nexisted, but not in the history of the world was it ever a craze, a\\r\\nmadness, until your time and mine. This lust has rotted these nations;\\r\\nit has made them hard, sordid, ungentle, dishonest, oppressive.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid England rise against the infamy of the Boer war? No--rose in favor\\r\\nof it. Did America rise against the infamy of the Phillipine war?\\r\\nNo--rose in favor of it. Did Russia rise against the infamy of the\\r\\npresent war? No--sat still and said nothing. Has the Kingdom of God\\r\\nadvanced in Russia since the beginning of time?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr in Europe and America, considering the vast backward step of the\\r\\nmoney-lust? Or anywhere else? If there has been any progress\\r\\ntoward righteousness since the early days of Creation--which, in my\\r\\nineradicable honesty, I am obliged to doubt--I think we must confine it\\r\\nto ten per cent of the populations of Christendom, (but leaving, Russia,\\r\\nSpain and South America entirely out.) This gives us 320,000,000 to draw\\r\\nthe ten per cent from. That is to say, 32,000,000 have advanced toward\\r\\nrighteousness and the Kingdom of God since the “ages and ages” have\\r\\nbeen flying along, the Deity sitting up there admiring. Well, you see\\r\\nit leaves 1,200,000,000 out of the race. They stand just where they have\\r\\nalways stood; there has been no change.\\r\\n\\r\\nN. B. No charge for these informations. Do come down soon, Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         With love,\\r\\n                                        MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     St. Clair McKelway, of The Brooklyn Eagle, narrowly escaped injuries\\r\\n     in a railway accident, and received the following.  Clemens and\\r\\n     McKelway were old friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo St. Clair McKelway, in Brooklyn:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        21 FIFTH AVE.  Sunday Morning.\\r\\n                                                  April 30, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR McKELWAY, Your innumerable friends are grateful, most grateful.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I understand the telegrams, the engineer of your train had never seen\\r\\na locomotive before. Very well, then, I am once more glad that there is\\r\\nan Ever-watchful Providence to foresee possible results and send Ogdens\\r\\nand McIntyres along to save our friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government’s Official report, showing that our railways killed\\r\\ntwelve hundred persons last year and injured sixty thousand convinces me\\r\\nthat under present conditions one Providence is not enough to\\r\\nproperly and efficiently take care of our railroad business. But it is\\r\\ncharacteristically American--always trying to get along short-handed and\\r\\nsave wages.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am helping your family congratulate themselves, and am your friend as\\r\\nalways.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Clemens did not spend any more summers at Quarry Farm.  All its\\r\\n     associations were beautiful and tender, but they could only sadden\\r\\n     him.  The life there had been as of another world, sunlit, idyllic,\\r\\n     now forever vanished.  For the summer of 1905 he leased the Copley\\r\\n     Green house at Dublin, New Hampshire, where there was a Boston\\r\\n     colony of writing and artistic folk, including many of his long-time\\r\\n     friends.  Among them was Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who\\r\\n     wrote a hearty letter of welcome when he heard the news.  Clemens\\r\\n     replied in kind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, in Boston:\\r\\n\\r\\n                              21 FIFTH AVE.  Sunday, March 26, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR COL. HIGGINSON,--I early learned that you would be my neighbor in\\r\\nthe Summer and I rejoiced, recognizing in you and your family a large\\r\\nasset. I hope for frequent intercourse between the two households. I\\r\\nshall have my youngest daughter with me. The other one will go from the\\r\\nrest-cure in this city to the rest-cure in Norfolk Conn and we shall not\\r\\nsee her before autumn. We have not seen her since the middle of October.\\r\\n\\r\\nJean (the youngest daughter) went to Dublin and saw the house and came\\r\\nback charmed with it. I know the Thayers of old--manifestly there is no\\r\\nlack of attractions up there. Mrs. Thayer and I were shipmates in a wild\\r\\nexcursion perilously near 40 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say you “send with this” the story. Then it should be here but it\\r\\nisn’t, when I send a thing with another thing, the other thing goes but\\r\\nthe thing doesn’t, I find it later--still on the premises. Will you look\\r\\nit up now and send it?\\r\\n\\r\\nAldrich was here half an hour ago, like a breeze from over the fields,\\r\\nwith the fragrance still upon his spirit. I am tired of waiting for that\\r\\nman to get old.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                                             S. L. C.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Mark Twain was in his seventieth year, old neither in mind nor body,\\r\\n     but willing to take life more quietly, to refrain from travel and\\r\\n     gay events.  A sort of pioneers’ reunion was to be held on the\\r\\n     Pacific Coast, and a letter from Robert Fulton, of Reno, Nevada,\\r\\n     invited Clemens to attend.  He did not go, but he sent a letter that\\r\\n     we may believe was the next best thing to those who heard it read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Robert Fulton, in Reno, Nevada:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  IN THE MOUNTAINS,\\r\\n                                                       May 24, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. FULTON,--I remember, as if it were yesterday, that when I\\r\\ndisembarked from the overland stage in front of the Ormsby in Carson\\r\\nCity in August, 1861, I was not expecting to be asked to come again.\\r\\nI was tired, discouraged, white with alkali dust, and did not know\\r\\nanybody; and if you had said then, “Cheer up, desolate stranger, don’t\\r\\nbe down-hearted--pass on, and come again in 1905,” you cannot think\\r\\nhow grateful I would have been and how gladly I would have closed the\\r\\ncontract. Although I was not expecting to be invited, I was watching\\r\\nout for it, and was hurt and disappointed when you started to ask me and\\r\\nchanged it to, “How soon are you going away?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you have made it all right, now, the wound is closed. And so I thank\\r\\nyou sincerely for the invitation; and with you, all Reno, and if I were\\r\\na few years younger I would accept it, and promptly. I would go. I would\\r\\nlet somebody else do the oration, but, as for me, I would talk--just\\r\\ntalk. I would renew my youth; and talk--and talk--and talk--and have\\r\\nthe time of my life! I would march the unforgotten and unforgettable\\r\\nantiques by, and name their names, and give them reverent\\r\\nHailand-farewell as they passed: Goodman, McCarthy, Gillis, Curry,\\r\\nBaldwin, Winters, Howard, Nye, Stewart; Neely Johnson, Hal Clayton,\\r\\nNorth, Root,--and my brother, upon whom be peace!--and then the\\r\\ndesperadoes, who made life a joy and the “Slaughter-house” a precious\\r\\npossession: Sam Brown, Farmer Pete, Bill Mayfield, Six-fingered Jake,\\r\\nJack Williams and the rest of the crimson discipleship--and so on and so\\r\\non. Believe me, I would start a resurrection it would do you more good\\r\\nto look at than the next one will, if you go on the way you are doing\\r\\nnow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose were the days! those old ones. They will come no more. Youth will\\r\\ncome no more. They were so full to the brim with the wine of life; there\\r\\nhave been no others like them. It chokes me up to think of them. Would\\r\\nyou like me to come out there and cry? It would not beseem my white\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood-bye. I drink to you all. Have a good time--and take an old man’s\\r\\nblessing.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    MARK TWAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     A few days later he was writing to H. H. Bancroft, of San Francisco,\\r\\n     who had invited him for a visit in event of his coming to the Coast.\\r\\n     Henry James had just been there for a week and it was hoped that\\r\\n     Howells would soon follow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo H. H. Bancroft, in San Francisco:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE,\\r\\n                                                       May 27, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. BANCROFT,--I thank you sincerely for the tempting hospitalities\\r\\nwhich you offer me, but I have to deny myself, for my wandering days are\\r\\nover, and it is my desire and purpose to sit by the fire the rest of\\r\\nmy remnant of life and indulge myself with the pleasure and repose of\\r\\nwork--work uninterrupted and unmarred by duties or excursions.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man who like me, is going to strike 70 on the 30th of next November\\r\\nhas no business to be flitting around the way Howells does--that\\r\\nshameless old fictitious butter fly.

C.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Clemens found that the air of the New Hampshire hills agreed with\\r\\n     him and stimulated him to work.  He began an entirely new version of\\r\\n     The Mysterious Stranger, of which he already had a bulky and nearly\\r\\n     finished manuscript, written in Vienna.  He wrote several hundred\\r\\n     pages of an extravaganza entitled, Three Thousand Years Among the\\r\\n     Microbes, and then, having got his superabundant vitality reduced\\r\\n     (it was likely to expend itself in these weird mental exploits),\\r\\n     he settled down one day and wrote that really tender and beautiful\\r\\n     idyl, Eve’s Diary, which he had begun, or at least planned, the\\r\\n     previous summer at Tyringham.  In a letter to Mr. Frederick A.\\r\\n     Duneka, general manager of Harper & Brothers, he tells something of\\r\\n     the manner of the story; also his revised opinion of Adam’s Diary,\\r\\n     written in ‘93, and originally published as a souvenir of Niagara\\r\\n     Falls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Frederick A. Duneka, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  DUBLIN, July 16, ‘05.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. DUNEKA,--I wrote Eve’s Diary, she using Adam’s Diary as her\\r\\n(unwitting and unconscious) text, of course, since to use any other text\\r\\nwould have been an imbecility--then I took Adam’s Diary and read it.\\r\\nIt turned my stomach. It was not literature; yet it had been literature\\r\\nonce--before I sold it to be degraded to an advertisement of the Buffalo\\r\\nFair. I was going to write and ask you to melt the plates and put it out\\r\\nof print.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this morning I examined it without temper, and saw that if I\\r\\nabolished the advertisement it would be literature again.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I have done it. I have struck out 700 words and inserted 5 MS pages\\r\\nof new matter (650 words), and now Adam’s Diary is dam good--sixty times\\r\\nas good as it ever was before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe it is as good as Eve’s Diary now--no, it’s not quite that\\r\\ngood, I guess, but it is good enough to go in the same cover with Eve’s.\\r\\nI’m sure of that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hate to have the old Adam go out any more--don’t put it on the presses\\r\\nagain, let’s put the new one in place of it; and next Xmas, let us bind\\r\\nAdam and Eve in one cover. They score points against each other--so, if\\r\\nnot bound together, some of the points would not be perceived.....\\r\\n\\r\\nP. S. Please send another Adam’s Diary, so that I can make 2 revised\\r\\ncopies. Eve’s Diary is Eve’s love-Story, but we will not name it that.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   Yrs ever,\\r\\n                                                  MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The peace-making at Portsmouth between Japan and Russia was not\\r\\n     satisfactory to Mark Twain, who had fondly hoped there would be no\\r\\n     peace until, as he said, “Russian liberty was safe.  One more battle\\r\\n     would have abolished the waiting chains of millions upon millions of\\r\\n     unborn Russians and I wish it could have been fought.”  He set down\\r\\n     an expression of his feelings for the Associated Press, and it\\r\\n     invited many letters.  Charles Francis Adams wrote, “It attracted my\\r\\n     attention because it so exactly expresses the views I have myself\\r\\n     all along entertained.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     Clemens was invited by Colonel George Harvey to dine with the\\r\\n     Russian emissaries, Baron Rosen and Sergius Witte.  He declined, but\\r\\n     his telegram so pleased Witte that he asked permission to publish\\r\\n     it, and announced that he would show it to the Czar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n              Telegram.

Livy, dressed in black, was\\r\\nsitting up in my bed (here) at my right and looking as young and sweet\\r\\nas she used to do when she was in health. She said: “what is the name of\\r\\nyour sweet sister?” I said, “Pamela.” “Oh, yes, that is it, I thought it\\r\\nwas--” (naming a name which has escaped me) “Won’t you write it down for\\r\\nme?” I reached eagerly for a pen and pad--laid my hands upon both--then\\r\\nsaid to myself, “It is only a dream,” and turned back sorrowfully and\\r\\nthere she was, still. The conviction flamed through me that our lamented\\r\\ndisaster was a dream, and this a reality. I said, “How blessed it is,\\r\\nhow blessed it is, it was all a dream, only a dream!” She only smiled\\r\\nand did not ask what dream I meant, which surprised me. She leaned her\\r\\nhead against mine and I kept saying, “I was perfectly sure it was a\\r\\ndream, I never would have believed it wasn’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI think she said several things, but if so they are gone from my memory.\\r\\nI woke and did not know I had been dreaming. She was gone. I wondered\\r\\nhow she could go without my knowing it, but I did not spend any thought\\r\\nupon that, I was too busy thinking of how vivid and real was the dream\\r\\nthat we had lost her and how unspeakably blessed it was to find that it\\r\\nwas not true and that she was still ours and with us.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       S.

The idea appealed to him;\\r\\n     he replied at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mrs. Fiske:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MRS. FISKE,--I shall certainly write the story. But I may not get\\r\\nit to suit me, in which case it will go in the fire. Later I will try\\r\\nagain--and yet again--and again. I am used to this. It has taken me\\r\\ntwelve years to write a short story--the shortest one I ever wrote, I\\r\\nthink.--[Probably “The Death Disk.”]--So do not be discouraged; I will\\r\\nstick to this one in the same way.

DUNEKA,--I have just finished a short story which I “greatly\\r\\nadmire,” and so will you--“A Horse’s Tale”--about 15,000 words, at\\r\\na rough guess. It has good fun in it, and several characters, and is\\r\\nlively. I shall finish revising it in a few days or more, then Jean will\\r\\ntype it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon’t you think you can get it into the Jan. and Feb. numbers and issue\\r\\nit as a dollar booklet just after the middle of Jan. when you issue the\\r\\nFeb. number?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt ought to be ably illustrated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy not sell simultaneous rights, for this once, to the Ladies’ Home\\r\\nJournal or Collier’s, or both, and recoup yourself?--for I would like\\r\\nto get it to classes that can’t afford Harper’s. Although it doesn’t\\r\\npreach, there’s a sermon concealed in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Yr sincerely,\\r\\n                                             MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Five days later he added some rather interesting facts concerning\\r\\n     the new story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo F. A. Duneka, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        Oct.  7, 1906. [’05]\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. DUNEKA,--... I’ve made a poor guess as to number of words.\\r\\nI think there must be 20,000. My usual page of MS. contains about 130\\r\\nwords; but when I am deeply interested in my work and dead to everything\\r\\nelse, my hand-writing shrinks and shrinks until there’s a great deal\\r\\nmore than 130 on a page--oh, yes, a deal more. Well, I discover, this\\r\\nmorning, that this tale is written in that small hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis strong interest is natural, for the heroine is my daughter, Susy,\\r\\nwhom we lost. It was not intentional--it was a good while before I found\\r\\nit out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I am sending you her picture to use--and to reproduce with\\r\\nphotographic exactness the unsurpassable expression and all. May you\\r\\nfind an artist who has lost an idol!\\r\\n\\r\\nTake as good care of the picture as you can and restore it to me when I\\r\\ncome.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you will illustrate this tale considerably. Not humorous\\r\\npictures. No. When they are good (or bad) one’s humor gets no chance to\\r\\nplay surprises on the reader. A humorous subject illustrated seriously\\r\\nis all right, but a humorous artist is no fit person for such work. You\\r\\nsee, the humorous writer pretends to absolute seriousness (when he\\r\\nknows his trade) then for an artist--to step in and give his calculated\\r\\ngravity all away with a funny picture--oh, my land! It gives me the dry\\r\\ngripes just to think of it. It would be just about up to the average\\r\\ncomic artist’s intellectual level to make a funny picture of the horse\\r\\nkicking the lungs out of a trader. Hang it, the remark is funny--because\\r\\nthe horse is not aware of it but the fact is not humorous, it is tragic\\r\\nand it is no subject for a humorous picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nCould I be allowed to sit in judgment upon the pictures before they are\\r\\naccepted--at least those in which Cathy may figure?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not essential. It is but a suggestion, and it is hereby\\r\\nwithdrawn, if it would be troublesome or cause delay.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you will reproduce the cat-pile, full page. And save the photo\\r\\nfor me in as good condition as possible. When Susy and Clara were little\\r\\ntots those cats had their profoundest worship, and there is no duplicate\\r\\nof this picture. These cats all had thundering names, or inappropriate\\r\\nones--furnished by the children with my help. One was named Buffalo\\r\\nBill.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre you interested in coincidences?\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter discovering, about the middle of the book, that Cathy was Susy\\r\\nClemens, I put her picture with my MS., to be reproduced. After the book\\r\\nwas finished it was discovered that Susy had a dim model of Soldier Boy\\r\\nin her arms; I had forgotten all about that toy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I examined the cat-picture and laid it with the MS. for\\r\\nintroduction; but it was not until yesterday that I remembered that one\\r\\nof the cats was named Buffalo Bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                                                  MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The reference in this letter to shrinkage of his hand-writing with\\r\\n     the increasing intensity of his interest, and the consequent\\r\\n     addition of the number of words to the page, recalls another fact,\\r\\n     noted by Mr. Duneka, viz.: that because of his terse Anglo-Saxon\\r\\n     diction, Mark Twain could put more words on a magazine page than any\\r\\n     other writer.  It is hardly necessary to add that he got more force\\r\\n     into what he put on the page for the same reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n     There was always a run of reporters at Mark Twain’s New York home.\\r\\n     His opinion was sought for on every matter of public interest, and\\r\\n     whatever happened to him in particular was considered good for at\\r\\n     least half a column of copy, with his name as a catch-line at the\\r\\n     top.  When it was learned that he was to spend the summer in New\\r\\n     Hampshire, the reporters had all wanted to find out about it.  Now\\r\\n     that the summer was ending, they began to want to know how he had\\r\\n     liked it, what work he had done and what were his plans for another\\r\\n     year.  As they frequently applied to his publishers for these\\r\\n     details it was finally suggested to him that he write a letter\\r\\n     furnishing the required information.  His reply, handed to Mr.\\r\\n     Duneka, who was visiting him at the moment, is full of interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Mem.  for Mr. Duneka:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  DUBLIN, Oct. 9, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\n... As to the other matters, here are the details.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, I have tried a number of summer homes, here and in Europe together.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of these homes had charms of its own; charms and delights of its\\r\\nown, and some of them--even in Europe had comforts. Several of them had\\r\\nconveniences, too. They all had a “view.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is my conviction that there should always be some water in a view--a\\r\\nlake or a river, but not the ocean, if you are down on its level. I\\r\\nthink that when you are down on its level it seldom inflames you with an\\r\\necstasy which you could not get out of a sand-flat. It is like being on\\r\\nboard ship, over again; indeed it is worse than that, for there’s three\\r\\nmonths of it. On board ship one tires of the aspects in a couple of\\r\\ndays, and quits looking. The same vast circle of heaving humps is spread\\r\\naround you all the time, with you in the centre of it and never gaining\\r\\nan inch on the horizon, so far as you can see; for variety, a flight\\r\\nof flying-fish, mornings; a flock of porpoises throwing summersaults\\r\\nafternoons; a remote whale spouting, Sundays; occasional phosphorescent\\r\\neffects, nights; every other day a streak of black smoke trailing along\\r\\nunder the horizon; on the one single red letter day, the illustrious\\r\\niceberg. I have seen that iceberg thirty-four times in thirty-seven\\r\\nvoyages; it is always the same shape, it is always the same size, it\\r\\nalways throws up the same old flash when the sun strikes it; you may set\\r\\nit on any New York door-step of a June morning and light it up with a\\r\\nmirror-flash; and I will engage to recognize it. It is artificial, and\\r\\nit is provided and anchored out by the steamer companies. I used to like\\r\\nthe sea, but I was young then, and could easily get excited over any\\r\\nkind of monotony, and keep it up till the monotonies ran out, if it was\\r\\na fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast January, when we were beginning to inquire about a home for this\\r\\nsummer, I remembered that Abbott Thayer had said, three years before,\\r\\nthat the New Hampshire highlands was a good place. He was right--it was\\r\\na good place. Any place that is good for an artist in paint is good\\r\\nfor an artist in morals and ink. Brush is here, too; so is Col. T. W.\\r\\nHigginson; so is Raphael Pumpelly; so is Mr. Secretary Hitchcock; so is\\r\\nHenderson; so is Learned; so is Summer; so is Franklin MacVeigh; so is\\r\\nJoseph L. Smith; so is Henry Copley Greene, when I am not occupying\\r\\nhis house, which I am doing this season. Paint, literature, science,\\r\\nstatesmanship, history, professorship, law, morals,--these are all\\r\\nrepresented here, yet crime is substantially unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summer homes of these refugees are sprinkled, a mile apart, among\\r\\nthe forest-clad hills, with access to each other by firm smooth country\\r\\nroads which are so embowered in dense foliage that it is always twilight\\r\\nin there, and comfortable. The forests are spider-webbed with these good\\r\\nroads, they go everywhere; but for the help of the guide-boards, the\\r\\nstranger would not arrive anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village--Dublin--is bunched together in its own place, but a good\\r\\ntelephone service makes its markets handy to all those outliars. I\\r\\nhave spelt it that way to be witty. The village executes orders on, the\\r\\nBoston plan--promptness and courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summer homes are high-perched, as a rule, and have contenting\\r\\noutlooks. The house we occupy has one. Monadnock, a soaring double hump,\\r\\nrises into the sky at its left elbow--that is to say, it is close at\\r\\nhand. From the base of the long slant of the mountain the valley spreads\\r\\naway to the circling frame of the hills, and beyond the frame the\\r\\nbillowy sweep of remote great ranges rises to view and flows, fold upon\\r\\nfold, wave upon wave, soft and blue and unwordly, to the horizon fifty\\r\\nmiles away. In these October days Monadnock and the valley and its\\r\\nframing hills make an inspiring picture to look at, for they are\\r\\nsumptuously splashed and mottled and be-torched from sky-line to\\r\\nsky-line with the richest dyes the autumn can furnish; and when they lie\\r\\nflaming in the full drench of the mid-afternoon sun, the sight affects\\r\\nthe spectator physically, it stirs his blood like military music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese summer homes are commodious, well built, and well furnished--facts\\r\\nwhich sufficiently indicate that the owners built them to live in\\r\\nthemselves. They have furnaces and wood fireplaces, and the rest of\\r\\nthe comforts and conveniences of a city home, and can be comfortably\\r\\noccupied all the year round.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot have this house next season, but I have secured Mrs. Upton’s\\r\\nhouse which is over in the law and science quarter, two or three miles\\r\\nfrom here, and about the same distance from the art, literary, and\\r\\nscholastic groups. The science and law quarter has needed improving,\\r\\nthis good while.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nearest railway-station is distant something like an hour’s drive;\\r\\nit is three hours from there to Boston, over a branch line. You can go\\r\\nto New York in six hours per branch lines if you change cars every time\\r\\nyou think of it, but it is better to go to Boston and stop over and take\\r\\nthe trunk line next day, then you do not get lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is claimed that the atmosphere of the New Hampshire highlands is\\r\\nexceptionally bracing and stimulating, and a fine aid to hard and\\r\\ncontinuous work. It is a just claim, I think. I came in May, and wrought\\r\\n35 successive days without a break. It is possible that I could not have\\r\\ndone it elsewhere. I do not know; I have not had any disposition to try\\r\\nit, before. I think I got the disposition out of the atmosphere, this\\r\\ntime. I feel quite sure, in fact, that that is where it came from.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am ashamed to confess what an intolerable pile of manuscript I ground\\r\\nout in the 35 days, therefore I will keep the number of words to myself.\\r\\nI wrote the first half of a long tale--“The Adventures of a Microbe”\\r\\n and put it away for a finish next summer, and started another long\\r\\ntale--“The Mysterious Stranger;” I wrote the first half of it and put\\r\\nit with the other for a finish next summer. I stopped, then. I was not\\r\\ntired, but I had no books on hand that needed finishing this year except\\r\\none that was seven years old. After a little I took that one up and\\r\\nfinished it. Not for publication, but to have it ready for revision next\\r\\nsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I stopped work I have had a two months’ holiday. The summer has\\r\\nbeen my working time for 35 years; to have a holiday in it (in America)\\r\\nis new for me. I have not broken it, except to write “Eve’s Diary” and\\r\\n“A Horse’s Tale”--short things occupying the mill 12 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year our summer is 6 months long and ends with November and the\\r\\nflight home to New York, but next year we hope and expect to stretch it\\r\\nanother month and end it the first of December.\\r\\n\\r\\n                             [No signature.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The fact that he was a persistent smoker was widely known, and many\\r\\n     friends and admirers of Mark Twain sent him cigars, most of which he\\r\\n     could not use, because they were too good.  He did not care for\\r\\n     Havana cigars, but smoked the fragrant, inexpensive domestic tobacco\\r\\n     with plenty of “pep” in it, as we say today.  Now and then he had an\\r\\n     opportunity to head off some liberal friend, who wrote asking\\r\\n     permission to contribute to his cigar collection, as instance the\\r\\n     following.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rev. L. M. Powers, in Haverhill, Mass.:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  Nov. 9, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. POWERS,--I should accept your hospitable offer at once but for\\r\\nthe fact I couldn’t do it and remain honest. That is to say if I allowed\\r\\nyou to send me what you believe to be good cigars it would distinctly\\r\\nmean that I meant to smoke them, whereas I should do nothing of the\\r\\nkind. I know a good cigar better than you do, for I have had 60 years\\r\\nexperience.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, that is not what I mean; I mean I know a bad cigar better than\\r\\nanybody else; I judge by the price only; if it costs above 5 cents I\\r\\nknow it to be either foreign or half-foreign, and unsmokeable. By me I\\r\\nhave many boxes of Havana cigars, of all prices from 20 cts apiece up to\\r\\n1.66 apiece; I bought none of them, they were all presents, they are an\\r\\naccumulation of several years. I have never smoked one of them and never\\r\\nshall, I work them off on the visitor. You shall have a chance when you\\r\\ncome.\\r\\n\\r\\nPessimists are born not made; optimists are born not made; but no man\\r\\nis born either pessimist wholly or optimist wholly, perhaps; he is\\r\\npessimistic along certain lines and optimistic along certain others.\\r\\nThat is my case.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                              S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     In spite of all the fine photographs that were made of him, there\\r\\n     recurred constantly among those sent him to be autographed a print\\r\\n     of one which, years before, Sarony had made and placed on public\\r\\n     sale.  It was a good photograph, mechanically and even artistically,\\r\\n     but it did not please Mark Twain.  Whenever he saw it he recalled\\r\\n     Sarony with bitterness and severity.  Once he received an inquiry\\r\\n     concerning it, and thus feelingly expressed himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. Row (no address):\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             21 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK,\\r\\n                                                  November 14, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. ROW,--That alleged portrait has a private history. Sarony was\\r\\nas much of an enthusiast about wild animals as he was about photography;\\r\\nand when Du Chaillu brought the first Gorilla to this country in 1819\\r\\nhe came to me in a fever of excitement and asked me if my father was of\\r\\nrecord and authentic. I said he was; then Sarony, without any abatement\\r\\nof his excitement asked if my grandfather also was of record and\\r\\nauthentic. I said he was. Then Sarony, with still rising excitement\\r\\nand with joy added to it, said he had found my great grandfather in the\\r\\nperson of the gorilla, and had recognized him at once by his resemblance\\r\\nto me. I was deeply hurt but did not reveal this, because I knew Saxony\\r\\nmeant no offense for the gorilla had not done him any harm, and he was\\r\\nnot a man who would say an unkind thing about a gorilla wantonly. I went\\r\\nwith him to inspect the ancestor, and examined him from several points\\r\\nof view, without being able to detect anything more than a passing\\r\\nresemblance. “Wait,” said Sarony with confidence, “let me show you.”\\r\\n He borrowed my overcoat--and put it on the gorilla. The result was\\r\\nsurprising. I saw that the gorilla while not looking distinctly like me\\r\\nwas exactly what my great grand father would have looked like if I had\\r\\nhad one. Sarong photographed the creature in that overcoat, and spread\\r\\nthe picture about the world. It has remained spread about the world ever\\r\\nsince. It turns up every week in some newspaper somewhere or other. It\\r\\nis not my favorite, but to my exasperation it is everybody else’s. Do\\r\\nyou think you could get it suppressed for me? I will pay the limit.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                                        S. L.

LETTERS, 1906, TO VARIOUS PERSONS. THE FAREWELL LECTURE. A SECOND\\r\\nSUMMER IN DUBLIN. BILLIARDS AND COPYRIGHT.\\r\\n\\r\\n     MARK TWAIN at “Pier Seventy,” as he called it, paused to look\\r\\n     backward and to record some memoirs of his long, eventful past.  The\\r\\n     Autobiography dictations begun in Florence were resumed, and daily\\r\\n     he traveled back, recalling long-ago scenes and all-but-forgotten\\r\\n     places.  He was not without reminders.  Now and again there came\\r\\n     some message that brought back the old days--the Tom Sawyer and Huck\\r\\n     Finn days--or the romance of the river that he never recalled other\\r\\n     than with tenderness and a tone of regret that it was gone.  An\\r\\n     invitation to the golden wedding of two ancient friends moved and\\r\\n     saddened him, and his answer to it conveys about all the story of\\r\\n     life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gordon:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       21 FIFTH AVENUE,\\r\\n                                                       Jan. 24, ‘06.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR GORDONS,--I have just received your golden-wedding “At Home” and\\r\\nam trying to adjust my focus to it and realize how much it means. It is\\r\\ninconceivable! With a simple sweep it carries me back over a stretch of\\r\\ntime measurable only in astronomical terms and geological periods. It\\r\\nbrings before me Mrs. Gordon, young, round-limbed, handsome; and\\r\\nwith her the Youngbloods and their two babies, and Laura Wright, that\\r\\nunspoiled little maid, that fresh flower of the woods and the prairies.\\r\\nForty-eight years ago!\\r\\n\\r\\nLife was a fairy-tale, then, it is a tragedy now. When I was 43 and John\\r\\nHay 41 he said life was a tragedy after 40, and I disputed it. Three\\r\\nyears ago he asked me to testify again: I counted my graves, and there\\r\\nwas nothing for me to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am old; I recognize it but I don’t realize it. I wonder if a person\\r\\never really ceases to feel young--I mean, for a whole day at a time. My\\r\\nlove to you both, and to all of us that are left.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Though he used very little liquor of any kind, it was Mark Twain’s\\r\\n     custom to keep a bottle of Scotch whiskey with his collection of\\r\\n     pipes and cigars and tobacco on a little table by his bed-side.\\r\\n     During restless nights he found a small quantity of it conducive to\\r\\n     sleep.  Andrew Carnegie, learning of this custom, made it his\\r\\n     business to supply Scotch of his own special importation.  The first\\r\\n     case came, direct from Scotland.  When it arrived Clemens sent this\\r\\n     characteristic acknowledgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Andrew Carnegie, in Scotland:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        21 FIFTH AVE.  Feb. 10, ‘06.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR ST. ANDREW,--The whisky arrived in due course from over the water;\\r\\nlast week one bottle of it was extracted from the wood and inserted into\\r\\nme, on the instalment plan, with this result: that I believe it to be\\r\\nthe best, smoothest whisky now on the planet. Thanks, oh, thanks: I have\\r\\ndiscarded Peruna.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoping that you three are well and happy and will be coming back before\\r\\nthe winter sets in.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         I am,\\r\\n                              Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                                        MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     It must have been a small bottle to be consumed by him in a week, or\\r\\n     perhaps he had able assistance.

CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The series of letters which follows was prepared by Mark Twain and\\r\\n     General Fred Grant, mainly with a view of advertising the lecture\\r\\n     that Clemens had agreed to deliver for the benefit of the Robert\\r\\n     Fulton Monument Association.  It was, in fact, to be Mark Twain’s\\r\\n     “farewell lecture,” and the association had really proposed to pay\\r\\n     him a thousand dollars for it.  The exchange of these letters,\\r\\n     however, was never made outside of Mark Twain’s bed-room.  Propped\\r\\n     against the pillows, pen in hand, with General Grant beside him,\\r\\n     they arranged the series with the idea of publication.  Later the\\r\\n     plan was discarded, so that this pleasant foolery appears here for\\r\\n     the first, time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                         PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL\\r\\n\\r\\n                             (Correspondence)\\r\\n\\r\\n                                 Telegram\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             Army Headquarters (date)\\r\\nMARK TWAIN, New York,--Would you consider a proposal to talk at Carnegie\\r\\nHall for the benefit of the Robert Fulton Monument Association, of which\\r\\nyou are a Vice President, for a fee of a thousand dollars?\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        F.

I love to hear myself talk, because I get so much\\r\\ninstruction and moral upheaval out of it, but I lose the bulk of this\\r\\njoy when I charge for it. Let the terms stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral, if I have your approval, I wish to use this good occasion to\\r\\nretire permanently from the platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   Truly yours\\r\\n                                             S.

Why should you?--you are not old yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Yours truly,\\r\\n                                        FRED D. GRANT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR GENERAL,--I mean the pay-platform; I shan’t retire from the\\r\\ngratis-platform until after I am dead and courtesy requires me to keep\\r\\nstill and not disturb the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat shall I talk about? My idea is this: to instruct the audience about\\r\\nRobert Fulton, and.... Tell me--was that his real name, or was it his\\r\\nnom de plume? However, never mind, it is not important--I can skip it,\\r\\nand the house will think I knew all about it, but forgot. Could you find\\r\\nout for me if he was one of the Signers of the Declaration, and which\\r\\none? But if it is any trouble, let it alone, I can skip it. Was he out\\r\\nwith Paul Jones? Will you ask Horace Porter? And ask him if he brought\\r\\nboth of them home. These will be very interesting facts, if they can be\\r\\nestablished. But never mind, don’t trouble Porter, I can establish them\\r\\nanyway. The way I look at it, they are historical gems--gems of the very\\r\\nfirst water.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, that is my idea, as I have said: first, excite the audience with\\r\\na spoonful of information about Fulton, then quiet down with a barrel\\r\\nof illustration drawn by memory from my books--and if you don’t say\\r\\nanything the house will think they never heard of it before, because\\r\\npeople don’t really read your books, they only say they do, to keep\\r\\nyou from feeling bad. Next, excite the house with another spoonful\\r\\nof Fultonian fact, then tranquilize them again with another barrel of\\r\\nillustration. And so on and so on, all through the evening; and if you\\r\\nare discreet and don’t tell them the illustrations don’t illustrate\\r\\nanything, they won’t notice it and I will send them home as\\r\\nwell-informed about Robert Fulton as I am myself. Don’t be afraid; I\\r\\nknow all about audiences, they believe everything you say, except when\\r\\nyou are telling the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Truly yours,\\r\\n                                   S.

I ask in order that we may\\r\\nbe able to say when carriages may be called.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Very Truly yours,\\r\\n                              HUGH GORDON MILLER,\\r\\n                                        Secretary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR.

Sometimes it takes an hour and\\r\\nfifteen minutes, sometimes I can do it in an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Sincerely yours,\\r\\n                                        S. L.

C.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want Fred Grant (in uniform) on the stage; also the rest of the\\r\\nofficials of the Association; also other distinguished people--all the\\r\\nattractions we can get. Also, a seat for Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine, who\\r\\nmay be useful to me if he is near me and on the front.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        S. L. C.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The seat chosen for the writer of these notes was to be at the front\\r\\n     of the stage in order that the lecturer might lean over now and then\\r\\n     and pretend to be asking information concerning Fulton.  I was not\\r\\n     entirely happy in the thought of this showy honor, and breathed more\\r\\n     freely when this plan was abandoned and the part assigned to General\\r\\n     Grant.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The lecture was given in Carnegie Hall, which had been gayly\\r\\n     decorated for the occasion.  The house was more than filled, and a\\r\\n     great sum of money was realized for the fund.\\r\\n\\r\\n     It was that spring that Gorky and Tchaikowski, the Russian\\r\\n     revolutionists, came to America hoping to arouse interest in their\\r\\n     cause.  The idea of the overthrow of the Russian dynasty was\\r\\n     pleasant to Mark Twain.  Few things would have given him greater\\r\\n     comfort than to have known that a little more than ten years would\\r\\n     see the downfall of Russian imperialism.  The letter which follows\\r\\n     was a reply to an invitation from Tchaikowski, urging him to speak\\r\\n     at one of the meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR. TCHAIKOWSKI,--I thank you for the honor of the invitation,\\r\\nbut I am not able to accept it, because on Thursday evening I shall be\\r\\npresiding at a meeting whose object is to find remunerative work for\\r\\ncertain classes of our blind who would gladly support themselves if they\\r\\nhad the opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sympathies are with the Russian revolution, of course. It goes\\r\\nwithout saying. I hope it will succeed, and now that I have talked with\\r\\nyou I take heart to believe it will. Government by falsified promises;\\r\\nby lies, by treacheries, and by the butcher-knife for the aggrandizement\\r\\nof a single family of drones and its idle and vicious kin has been borne\\r\\nquite long enough in Russia, I should think, and it is to be hoped that\\r\\nthe roused nation, now rising in its strength, will presently put an\\r\\nend to it and set up the republic in its place. Some of us, even of the\\r\\nwhite headed, may live to see the blessed day when Czars and Grand Dukes\\r\\nwill be as scarce there as I trust they are in heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Most sincerely yours,\\r\\n                                                  MARK TWAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     There came another summer at Dublin, New Hampshire, this time in the\\r\\n     fine Upton residence on the other slope of Monadnock, a place of\\r\\n     equally beautiful surroundings, and an even more extended view.\\r\\n     Clemens was at this time working steadily on his so-called\\r\\n     Autobiography, which was not that, in fact, but a series of\\r\\n     remarkable chapters, reminiscent, reflective, commentative, written\\r\\n     without any particular sequence as to time or subject-matter.  He\\r\\n     dictated these chapters to a stenographer, usually in the open air,\\r\\n     sitting in a comfortable rocker or pacing up and down the long\\r\\n     veranda that faced a vast expanse of wooded slope and lake and\\r\\n     distant blue mountains.  It became one of the happiest occupations\\r\\n     of his later years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo W. D. Howells, in Maine:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   DUBLIN, Sunday, June 17, ‘06.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR HOWELLS,--..... The dictating goes lazily and pleasantly on. With\\r\\nintervals. I find that I have been at it, off and on, nearly two hours a\\r\\nday for 155 days, since Jan. 9. To be exact I’ve dictated 75 hours in 80\\r\\ndays and loafed 75 days. I’ve added 60,000 words in the month that I’ve\\r\\nbeen here; which indicates that I’ve dictated during 20 days of that\\r\\ntime--40 hours, at an average of 1,500 words an hour. It’s a plenty, and\\r\\nI am satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s a good deal of “fat” I’ve dictated, (from Jan. 9) 210,000 words,\\r\\nand the “fat” adds about 50,000 more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “fat” is old pigeon-holed things, of the years gone by, which I or\\r\\neditors didn’t das’t to print. For instance, I am dumping in the little\\r\\nold book which I read to you in Hartford about 30 years ago and which\\r\\nyou said “publish--and ask Dean Stanley to furnish an introduction;\\r\\nhe’ll do it.” (“Captain Stormfield’s Visit to Heaven.”) It reads quite\\r\\nto suit me, without altering a word, now that it isn’t to see print\\r\\nuntil I am dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-morrow I mean to dictate a chapter which will get my heirs and\\r\\nassigns burnt alive if they venture to print it this side of 2006\\r\\nA.D.--which I judge they won’t. There’ll be lots of such chapters if I\\r\\nlive 3 or 4 years longer. The edition of A.D. 2006 will make a stir when\\r\\nit comes out. I shall be hovering around taking notice, along with other\\r\\ndead pals. You are invited.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n     His tendency to estimate the measure of the work he was doing, and\\r\\n     had completed, must have clung to him from his old printer days.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The chapter which was to get his heirs and assigns burned alive was\\r\\n     on the orthodox God, and there was more than one such chapter.  In\\r\\n     the next letter he refers to two exquisite poems by Howells, and the\\r\\n     writer of these notes recalls his wonderful reading of them aloud.\\r\\n     ‘In Our Town’ was a collection of short stories then recently issued\\r\\n     by William Allen White.  Howells had recommended them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo W. D.

But I love you, that I know.\\r\\n\\r\\nI read “After the Wedding” aloud and we felt all the pain of it and\\r\\nthe truth. It was very moving and very beautiful--would have been\\r\\nover-comingly moving, at times, but for the haltings and pauses\\r\\ncompelled by the difficulties of MS--these were a protection, in that\\r\\nthey furnished me time to brace up my voice, and get a new start. Jean\\r\\nwanted to keep the MS for another reading-aloud, and for “keeps,” too, I\\r\\nsuspected, but I said it would be safest to write you about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like “In Our Town,” particularly that Colonel, of the Lookout Mountain\\r\\nOration, and very particularly pages 212-16. I wrote and told White so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter “After the Wedding” I read “The Mother” aloud and sounded its\\r\\nhuman deeps with your deep-sea lead. I had not read it before, since it\\r\\nwas first published.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been dictating some fearful things, for 4 successive\\r\\nmornings--for no eye but yours to see until I have been dead a\\r\\ncentury--if then. But I got them out of my system, where they had been\\r\\nfestering for years--and that was the main thing. I feel better, now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI came down today on business--from house to house in 12 1/2 hours, and\\r\\nexpected to arrive dead, but am neither tired nor sleepy.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Yours as always\\r\\n                                             MARK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo William Allen White, in Emporia, Kans.:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             DUBLIN, NEW HAMPSHIRE,\\r\\n                                                  June 24, 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MR.

He did not\\r\\n     advise him, however, to break away entirely from a salaried\\r\\n     position--at least not immediately; but one day Bynner did so, and\\r\\n     reported the step he had taken, with some doubt as to the answer he\\r\\n     would receive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Witter Bynner, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  DUBLIN, Oct. 5, 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR POET,--You have certainly done right for several good reasons; at\\r\\nleast, of them, I can name two:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. With your reputation you can have your freedom and yet earn your\\r\\nliving. 2. if you fall short of succeeding to your wish, your reputation\\r\\nwill provide you another job. And so in high approval I suppress the\\r\\nscolding and give you the saintly and fatherly pat instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  MARK TWAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     On another occasion, when Bynner had written a poem to Clara\\r\\n     Clemens, her father pretended great indignation that the first poem\\r\\n     written by Bynner to any one in his household should not be to him,\\r\\n     and threatened revenge.  At dinner shortly after he produced from\\r\\n     his pocket a slip of paper on which he had set down what he said was\\r\\n     “his only poem.”  He read the lines that follow:\\r\\n\\r\\n               “Of all sad words of tongue or pen,\\r\\n               The saddest are these: It might have been.\\r\\n               Ah, say not so! as life grows longer, leaner, thinner,\\r\\n               We recognize, O God, it might have Bynner!”\\r\\n\\r\\n     He returned to New York in October and soon after was presented by\\r\\n     Mrs. H. H. Rogers with a handsome billiard-table.\\r\\n\\r\\n     He had a passion for the game, but had played comparatively little\\r\\n     since the old Hartford days of fifteen years before, when a group of\\r\\n     his friends used to assemble on Friday nights in the room at the top\\r\\n     of the house for long, strenuous games and much hilarity.  Now the\\r\\n     old fever all came back; the fascinations of the game superseded\\r\\n     even his interest in the daily dictations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mrs. H. H. Rogers, in New York:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   21 FIFTH AVENUE, Monday, Nov., 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR MRS. ROGERS,--The billiard table is better than the doctors. It is\\r\\ndriving out the heartburn in a most promising way. I have a billiardist\\r\\non the premises, and I walk not less than ten miles every day with the\\r\\ncue in my hand. And the walking is not the whole of the exercise, nor\\r\\nthe most health-giving part of it, I think. Through the multitude of the\\r\\npositions and attitudes it brings into play every muscle in the body and\\r\\nexercises them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe games begin right after luncheon, daily, and continue until\\r\\nmidnight, with 2 hours’ intermission for dinner and music. And so it is\\r\\n9 hours’ exercise per day, and 10 or 12 on Sunday. Yesterday and last\\r\\nnight it was 12--and I slept until 8 this morning without waking.\\r\\nThe billiard table, as a Sabbath breaker can beat any coal-breaker in\\r\\nPennsylvania, and give it 30 in, the game. If Mr. Rogers will take to\\r\\ndaily billiards he can do without doctors and the massageur, I think.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are really going to build a house on my farm, an hour and a half from\\r\\nNew York. It is decided. It is to be built by contract, and is to come\\r\\nwithin $25,000.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    With love and many thanks.\\r\\n                                             S. L. C.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. Clara is in the sanitarium--till January 28 when her western\\r\\nconcert tour will begin. She is getting to be a mighty competent singer.\\r\\nYou must know Clara better; she is one of the very finest and completest\\r\\nand most satisfactory characters I have ever met. Others knew it before,\\r\\nbut I have always been busy with other matters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The “billiardist on the premises” was the writer of these notes,\\r\\n     who, earlier in the year, had become his biographer, and, in the\\r\\n     course of time, his daily companion and friend.  The farm mentioned\\r\\n     was one which he had bought at Redding, Connecticut, where, later,\\r\\n     he built the house known as “Stormfield.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     Henry Mills Alden, for nearly forty years editor of Harper’s\\r\\n     Magazine, arrived at his seventieth birthday on November 11th that\\r\\n     year, and Harper & Brothers had arranged to give him a great dinner\\r\\n     in the offices of Franklin Square, where, for half a century, he had\\r\\n     been an active force.  Mark Twain, threatened with a cold, and\\r\\n     knowing the dinner would be strenuous, did not feel able to attend,\\r\\n     so wrote a letter which, if found suitable, could be read at the\\r\\n     gathering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. Henry Alden:\\r\\n\\r\\nALDEN,--dear and ancient friend--it is a solemn moment. You have now\\r\\nreached the age of discretion. You have been a long time arriving. Many\\r\\nyears ago you docked me on an article because the subject was too old;\\r\\nlater, you docked me on an article because the subject was too new;\\r\\nlater still, you docked me on an article because the subject was betwixt\\r\\nand between. Once, when I wrote a Letter to Queen Victoria, you did not\\r\\nput it in the respectable part of the Magazine, but interred it in that\\r\\npotter’s field, the Editor’s Drawer. As a result, she never answered it.\\r\\nHow often we recall, with regret, that Napoleon once shot at a magazine\\r\\neditor and missed him and killed a publisher. But we remember, with\\r\\ncharity, that his intentions were good.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will reform, now, Alden. You will cease from these economies, and\\r\\nyou will be discharged. But in your retirement you will carry with you\\r\\nthe admiration and earnest good wishes of the oppressed and toiling\\r\\nscribes. This will be better than bread. Let this console you when the\\r\\nbread fails.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will carry with you another thing, too--the affection of the\\r\\nscribes; for they all love you in spite of your crimes. For you bear a\\r\\nkind heart in your breast, and the sweet and winning spirit that charms\\r\\naway all hostilities and animosities, and makes of your enemy your\\r\\nfriend and keeps him so. You have reigned over us thirty-six years, and,\\r\\nplease God, you shall reign another thirty-six--“and peace to Mahmoud on\\r\\nhis golden throne!”\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Always yours\\r\\n                                   MARK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     A copyright bill was coming up in Washington and a delegation of\\r\\n     authors went down to work for it.  Clemens was not the head of the\\r\\n     delegation, but he was the most prominent member of it, as well as\\r\\n     the most useful.  He invited the writer to accompany him, and\\r\\n     elsewhere I have told in detail the story of that excursion,--[See\\r\\n     Mark Twain; A Biography, chap.  ccli,]--which need be but briefly\\r\\n     touched upon here.\\r\\n\\r\\n     His work was mainly done aside from that of the delegation.  They\\r\\n     had him scheduled for a speech, however, which he made without notes\\r\\n     and with scarcely any preparation.  Meantime he had applied to\\r\\n     Speaker Cannon for permission to allow him on the floor of the\\r\\n     House, where he could buttonhole the Congressmen.  He was not\\r\\n     eligible to the floor without having received the thanks of\\r\\n     Congress, hence the following letter:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Hon. Joseph Cannon, House of Representatives:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       Dec. 7, 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR UNCLE JOSEPH,--Please get me the thanks of the Congress--not next\\r\\nweek but right away. It is very necessary. Do accomplish this for\\r\\nyour affectionate old friend right away; by persuasion, if you can, by\\r\\nviolence if you must, for it is imperatively necessary that I get on\\r\\nthe floor for two or three hours and talk to the members, man by man,\\r\\nin behalf of the support, encouragement and protection of one of the\\r\\nnation’s most valuable assets and industries--its literature. I have\\r\\narguments with me, also a barrel, with liquid in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive me a chance. Get me the thanks of Congress. Don’t wait for\\r\\nothers; there isn’t time. I have stayed away and let Congress alone\\r\\nfor seventy-one years and I am entitled to thanks. Congress knows it\\r\\nperfectly well and I have long felt hurt that this quite proper and\\r\\nearned expression of gratitude has been merely felt by the House and\\r\\nnever publicly uttered. Send me an order on the Sergeant-at-Arms quick.\\r\\nWhen shall I come? With love and a benediction.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              MARK TWAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     This was mainly a joke.  Mark Twain did not expect any “thanks,” but\\r\\n     he did hope for access to the floor, which once, in an earlier day,\\r\\n     had been accorded him.  We drove to the Capitol and he delivered his\\r\\n     letter to “Uncle Joe” by hand.  “Uncle Joe” could not give him the\\r\\n     privilege of the floor; the rules had become more stringent.  He\\r\\n     declared they would hang him if he did such a thing.  He added that\\r\\n     he had a private room down-stairs, where Mark Twain might establish\\r\\n     headquarters, and that he would assign his colored servant, Neal, of\\r\\n     long acquaintanceship with many of the members, to pass the word\\r\\n     that Mark Twain was receiving.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The result was a great success.  All that afternoon members of\\r\\n     Congress poured into the Speaker’s room and, in an atmosphere blue\\r\\n     with tobacco smoke, Mark Twain talked the gospel of copyright to his\\r\\n     heart’s content.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The bill did not come up for passage that session, but Mark Twain\\r\\n     lived to see his afternoon’s lobbying bring a return.  In 1909,\\r\\n     Champ Clark, and those others who had gathered around him that\\r\\n     afternoon, passed a measure that added fourteen years to the\\r\\n     copyright term.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The next letter refers to a proposed lobby of quite a different\\r\\n     sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Helen Keller, in Wrentham, Mass.:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       21 FIFTH AVENUE,\\r\\n                                                       Dec.  23, ‘06.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR HELEN KELLER,--... You say, “As a reformer, you know that ideas\\r\\nmust be driven home again and again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, I know it; and by old experience I know that speeches and documents\\r\\nand public meetings are a pretty poor and lame way of accomplishing it.\\r\\nLast year I proposed a sane way--one which I had practiced with success\\r\\nfor a quarter of a century--but I wasn’t expecting it to get any\\r\\nattention, and it didn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive me a battalion of 200 winsome young girls and matrons, and let me\\r\\ntell them what to do and how to do it, and I will be responsible for\\r\\nshining results. If I could mass them on the stage in front of the\\r\\naudience and instruct them there, I could make a public meeting take\\r\\nhold of itself and do something really valuable for once. Not that\\r\\nthe real instruction would be done there, for it wouldn’t; it would be\\r\\npreviously done privately, and merely repeated there.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it isn’t going to happen--the good old way will be stuck to:\\r\\nthere’ll be a public meeting: with music, and prayer, and a wearying\\r\\nreport, and a verbal description of the marvels the blind can do, and\\r\\n17 speeches--then the call upon all present who are still alive, to\\r\\ncontribute. This hoary program was invented in the idiot asylum, and\\r\\nwill never be changed. Its function is to breed hostility to good\\r\\ncauses.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome day somebody will recruit my 200--my dear beguilesome Knights of\\r\\nthe Golden Fleece--and you will see them make good their ominous name.\\r\\n\\r\\nMind, we must meet! not in the grim and ghastly air of the platform,\\r\\nmayhap, but by the friendly fire--here at 21.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Affectionately your friend,\\r\\n                                   S. L. CLEMENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     They did meet somewhat later that winter in the friendly parlors of\\r\\n     No. 21, and friends gathered in to meet the marvelous blind girl and\\r\\n     to pay tribute to Miss Sullivan (Mrs. Macy) for her almost\\r\\n     incredible achievement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Letters Of Mark Twain, Volume 5,\\r\\n1901-1906, by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK'"
